N2  - A data warehouse is a central or specialized database used for business analysis and information extraction where the data is derived from multiple data sources. Amoco has taken this concept and applied it to the world wide engineering and construction sector (WE&C). Amoco needed to analyze historical construction project cost information for estimating new projects or revamping existing facilities. It developed a data warehouse named the cost engineering database. It captures data from multiple data sources and stores it in an Oracle database that is accessed by the users through a custom, user-friendly, front-end application developed using Power Builder.

N2  - A knowledge system for the retrieval of project knowledge from civil-engineering documents will be described from different views. The views demonstrate the research process, the knowledge acquisition process and the recovery structure of the knowledge system. The described knowledge system should provide the possibility to reuse construction knowledge locked in documents. The documents will be classified using text analysing methods combined with clustering techniques. A lexicon which includes important parts of knowledge like construction key words, synonyms etc. for the specific domain of the building process will be combined with a document class structure and project class structure. During the process of general text analyses the lexicon will be completed with the frequency of words structured in different clusters of the building process. The knowledge system built up, will be a long-term storage of project experiences for the building industry. © 2004 ASCE.

N2  - Construction is one of the most information intensive industries; typically professionals access the industry information resources on a daily basis. The major constraints to the future development of a formally encoded knowledge base are fragmented information sources and lack of comprehensive classification schemes. In agreement with earlier research and over twenty years of practical experience we have found that manually categorising a large collection of documents is error-prone, time-consuming, expensive and produces inconsistent results. Attempts over recent years to automate this using state-of-the-art categorisation techniques, have also proven to be wanting due to the shallow internal representation in the document set. In this paper we describe an approach to overcome this problem by combining the benefits of automated categorisation with efficient and effective use of human judgement. We present a tool based on this philosophy that utilises machine learning, information retrieval and information visualisation techniques to help bibliographers analyse the document collection. By analysing the content of the unstructured document, this tool suggests to the bibliographer keywords, subject headings and candidate documents to include under subject headings. This greatly increases the speed at which bibliographers can process the documents, increases the accuracy of their work and results in a categorisation system that reflects the terminology and relationships held in the actual knowledge base. This work is now being applied to enhance one of the market leading retrieval products in the construction industry.

N2  - The number of documents generated in a construction project and stored in interorganizational information systems is significant. Since a large percentage of these project documents are generated in text format, methods for organizing and improving access to the information contained in these types of documents become essential to construction information management. Information classification schemes can be used for this purpose. They provide a common framework to enact document organization and information exchange among project members. Current systems for document management rely on manual classification methods controlled by human experts. Due to the widespread use of information technologies for construction, the increasing availability of electronic documents, and the development of systems based on project object models, manual classification becomes unfeasible. This paper presents a unique way to improve information organization and access in interorganizational systems based on automated classification of construction project documents according to their related project components. Machine learning methods were used for this purpose. A prototype of a document classification system was developed to provide easy deployment and scalability to the classification process. © ASCE,.

N2  - Construction impact claims analysis is mostly carried out after closure of operations. Revisiting a project's history, however, necessitates the use of contemporaneous documents produced by all participating groups. This practice is becoming ever more expensive because documents-paper or electronic-are never found in one place, and project groups use different document storage systems that are not necessarily compatible. As such, documents sprawling to various project locations without discernable directory structures complicate backing up and archiving of files, and make locating and accessing documents a difficult task. Cross-referencing every document that is issued by any group in the project with project's process information facilitates the solution. Currently, the industry is not unanimous on how to solve this problem and with slimming contractor profits (due to severe competition and increased projects" complexity) the construction industry has not invested sufficiently to develop data schemas to represent project documents' contents, or context. Modeling such information is necessary for mapping the knowledge contents into databases. This research identified the aforementioned discords and proposes a Web-Based solution: the Construction Project Document Information Center (CPDICenter).

N2  - This paper describes a method used to construct a thesaurus in the field of civil engineering. This work is an effort to investigate the potential of thesauri as a tool for information retrieval systems and as an aid in civil engineering. ThesWB, a tool that extracts terms and relations between them from HTML documents, was used for collecting candidate thesaurus terms from Web. The principal advantage of the Web as a source for thesaurus construction is that it can be viewed as a body of text containing two fundamentally different types of data: the contents and the tags. A tag in HTML is meta-data describing the layout and linking structure between the texts. For these kinds of documents we can apply different approaches to extract and structure terms automatically. ThesWB is used to construct domain independent thesaurus from HTML pages.

N2  - The widespread use of information technologies for construction is considerably increasing the number of electronic documents stored in inter-organizational construction management information systems. Since a large percentage of these project documents is generated in text format, methods for organizing and improving the access to the information contained in these types of documents becomes essential to construction information management. Document management techniques have been used for this purpose. One limitation of the document management aspects in current information systems is the reliance on manual classification methods. With the widespread use of information technologies for construction, the increasing availability of electronic documents, and the development of systems based on project object models, manual classification and organization becomes unfeasible. This paper describes a methodology to improve information organization and access in interorganizational systems based on automated classification of construction project documents according to their related project components.

N2  - The widespread use of information technologies for construction is considerably increasing the number of electronic text documents stored in construction management information systems. Consequently, automated methods for organizing and improving the access to the information contained in these types of documents become essential to construction information management. This paper describes a methodology developed to improve information organization and access in construction management information systems based on automatic hierarchical classification of construction project documents according to project components. A prototype system for document classification is presented, as well as the experiments conducted to verify the feasibility of the proposed approach. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - Project extranets are controlled-access websites that provide remote document management capability to participants of a construction enterprise. Most of these systems have standard document retrieval engines, based on keyword search, which do not provide adequate precision and recall to user queries. This paper proposes a knowledge-based information retrieval system for the building design and construction domain, to be integrated in project extranets. The system analyses information from the user query in order to infer what is the required information. Then it uses domain knowledge to discover which kinds of construction documents are the best candidates to fulfil that need. Further processing sets values for filtering parameters like file type, date and author. Finally, a ranking order for retrieved documents is computed for presentation to the user. © 2003, Civil-Comp Ltd.

N2  - This paper presents a conceptual model of a metadata-based information system for data exchange among Web-based documents for construction project management. The system retrieves useful data from the original documents, reorganizes the information according to specific tasks or users, and displays the information in an integrated web page. The study identifies the comprehensive functional requirements from existing Web-based collaboration systems, and finds out new user requirements by way of a Web-based survey in Singapore. Based on the requirement studies, a prototype model is developed using unified modeling language. Implementation of the conceptual model uses extensible markup language technology. Discussions on major concerns about information security, data accessibility, and service quality are included in this paper.

N2  - Objective: We combined payroll data, coded workers' compensation (WC) data, and text descriptions of injuries from the construction of Denver International Airport to create a more comprehensive picture of falls from height (FFH) than is typically available from WC data. Text descriptions were coded to identify circumstances surrounding falls. Slips/trips preceded one third of FFH, often involving motor vehicles or heavy equipment. Another third involved movement or collapse of work surfaces, usually ladders or scaffolds. Conclusions: The significant contribution of motor vehicles and heavy equipment to FFH, particularly those preceded by slips/trips, was not apparent from coded data. Heavy equipment engineering modifications are called for and workers in street/roadway construction/site development need fall protection training. Text analyses allow exploration of factors not identified at the time of data collection and better understanding of the context in which injuries occur.

N2  - This paper investigates the use of text analysis techniques to measure relevance between objects in product models. This relevance measure is used to support design reuse from an archive of product models from previous projects. We consider several techniques from the field of information retrieval for comparing documents. Next, we explore whether we can improve the performance of the relevance measure by considering contextual building model elements. The paper concludes with an evaluation and discussion of the techniques considered. We conclude that relatively good retrieval results can be achieved with short texts and sparse building models such as those that occur in current industry practice. © ASCE.

N2  - Engineering drawings produced by computer-aided design and drafting (CADD) software are widely employed in the construction industry, as well as many other manufacturing sectors. It is very common for a drawing plan to undergo many revisions, thus, many different versions of the drawing are generated before the final product is achieved. Thus, a drawing management system needs to maintain the history of different versions of drawings, and version control becomes a key function for any drawing management system. In this paper, a knowledge-based version information extraction method is presented. The method analyzes the layout of the drawing frame and extracts the version information with the help of predefined key words. Then a comparison method between two versions of drawing is introduced. The comparison method highlights the differences between two versions of the drawings, so that engineers can locate and find the changes quickly. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - This study was executed in order to develop a construction technology information system. This system is capable of efficient information storage, search, and share. The "Knowledge Document Management System (KDMS)" developed in this study stores the knowledge on a server and enables management of the information by various access systems. The KDM explorer function and file browser can manage personal files, and users are able to achieve flexible knowledge management through a file viewer and preview function. In addition, the content-based search function provides a word-highlighted simple search. The KDMS can be helpful in managing mass technical information by each project, and search information considering the characteristics of construction technological information.

N2  - Construction contracts are becoming progressively more complicated; the increase in complexity of construction processes, documents, and conditions of contracts have contributed to a higher possibility of disputes, conflicting interpretations, and adversarial attitudes. Both the public and private sector have been looking to the judicial system as the means for dispute resolution for claims that cannot be solved through the other means of resolutions such as negotiations and arbitration. This paper presents a methodology to classify and categorize Canadian case-law construction claims. A wide range of construction claims are collected from 10 different sources and are classified into 12 categories that follows the Canadian Construction Documents Committee (CCDC 2-1994) standard contract document. To further identify specific causes of a claim, the 12 categories were divided into 32 subcategories. 567 Canadian construction claims have been collected; 460 'limited claims' provide basic claim information and 107 'detailed claims' provide detailed information used to analyze the collected claims. The proposed methodology for collecting and classifying the cases is implemented in a computer-integrated system called the Canadian Construction Claim tracker (CCCT) that consists of one central database and three modules: a statistical module, a prediction module and a classification module. CCCT provides its users with easier and quicker access to past case-law claim information.

N2  - The paper argues that an effective solution to information and knowledge management (KM) needs of practitioners in the construction industry can be found in the provision of an adapted knowledge environment that makes use of user profiling and document summarization techniques based on information retrieval sciences. The conceptualization of the domain through ontology takes a pivotal role in the proposed knowledge environment and provides a semantic referential to ensure relevance, accuracy, and completeness of information. A set of KM services articulated around the selected ontology have been developed, using the Web services model, tested, and validated in real organizational settings. This provided the basis for formulating recommendations and key success factors for any KM project development. © ASCE/July/August 2006.

N2  - Corporate memory tools represent one way organizations can document, retrieve and utilize best practice and lessons learned in enhancing their performance. Using semantic systems in building these tools (along with database and/or AI-based systems) allows for more efficient representation of tacit knowledge. Such systems are based on a common ontology of the subject domain, where entities (such as actors, processes and products) are interlinked to represent the essence of the knowledge in the domain. The paper presents a taxonomy for building construction. The taxonomy includes 6000 concepts and was developed using OWL. It maps to existing classification systems to assure better coverage. The taxonomy is the first attempt to present building construction knowledge in a semantic way. It also represents the foundations developing ontology-based corporate memory systems. To demonstrate the role and contribution of the proposed taxonomy a prototypical ontology for building construction was developed. Furthermore, a framework for agent-based system for supporting semi-automatic generation of reports such as lessons learned, work forms, and meeting agendas. Such agents allow organizations to capture and document its knowledge (in a taxonomy-complaint format) and to feed back post-project knowledge into new ones through access to lessons learned and through pre-defined meeting agendas. Access to these reports is done through semantic search according to the proposed taxonomy. Future research will develop a formal ontology and further develop the framework and implement it in actual organizations. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - In the modern and dynamic construction environment it is important to access information in a fast and efficient manner in order to improve the decision making processes for construction managers. This capability is, in most cases, straightforward with today's technologies for data types with an inherent structure that resides primarily on established database structures like estimating and scheduling software. However, previous research has demonstrated that a significant percentage of construction data is stored in semi-structured or unstructured data formats (text, images, etc.) and that manually locating and identifying such data is a very hard and time-consuming task. This paper focuses on construction site image data and presents a novel image retrieval model that interfaces with established construction data management structures. This model is designed to retrieve images from related objects in project models or construction databases using location, date, and material information (extracted from the image content with pattern recognition techniques). © 2006 ASCE.

N2  - It is important that how to improve junior engineers efficiently acquire construction project's experience. For junior employee's training, how to effectively reuse the tacit knowledge through information technology becomes an important subject in construction. If the knowledge map could be applied in construction, it would achieve the following spots: (1) enhance the knowledge search efficiency for junior engineer, (2) improve the knowledge reuse in construction, reduce the barrier when construction enterprises implement electronic business, and (3) feed back the experience for developing construction knowledge management system. In order to apply knowledge map in this study, the research will utilize the junior engineer demand with expert interview method, and use the IDEF0 (Integration Definition Function Modeling) methodology to analysis the key factors when junior engineer reuse construction knowledge. Finally, the research will combine the knowledge classification structure, the related documents in construction process, the related websites in internet environment, and knowledge management system to build the individual knowledge map application process for junior engineer.

N2  - The paper describes the methodology used to develop a construction domain ontology, taking into account the wealth of existing semantic resources in the sector ranging from dictionaries to thesauri. Given the characteristics and settings of the construction industry, a modular, architecture-centric approach was adopted to structure and develop the ontology. The paper argues that taxonomies provide an ideal backbone for any ontology project. Therefore, a construction industry standard taxonomy was used to provide the seeds of the ontology, enriched and expanded with additional concepts extracted from large discipline-oriented document bases using information retrieval (IR) techniques. © 2007 Cambridge University Press.

N2  - In a paper-based paradigm, whether construction information is presented in structured or unstructured format is not a critical issue because human beings are good at processing both types of information. However, the paradigm shift from using paper-based media to electronic media requires better handling of unstructured information, as a computer is more adept at processing structured information. It is observed by the writers that many existing information systems in the construction industry simply mimic paper-based construction documents, not just in presentations but also in data structures, such as request for information (RFI) forms developed by many existing software vendors. The writers thus question whether enough attention has been put into understanding the impact of the paradigm shift on data management for construction documents. This paper argues that a construction document such as a RFI is usually used by construction professionals to serve particular business purposes, which restricts the content of such a document. Consequently, some types of unstructured information make references implicitly or explicitly to certain types of information that are often well structured such as building or project management information. Further, the occurrence of such cross references is constant and stable among different instances of the same type of documents. A major challenge is to properly capture, represent, and utilize such knowledge in order to improve information processing for construction professionals. Text analysis and statistical analysis are applied by this study to determine the patterns of the occurrences for certain types of concepts that are related to building components, contract documents, or project management in unstructured content. With the identified patterns, this paper further discusses the potential use of metadata models as a method to support processing unstructured content in those documents. © ASCE.

N2  - The construction industry uses both structured and unstructured information for communication, whether they are in paper or electronic format. As the paradigm begins to shift from using paper-based media to electronic media, the difference between structured and unstructured data becomes more prominent as computers are more adept at handling structured data or information. The challenge is the effective management of both types of information in a fragmented data environment. To maintain efficiency and flexibility for project participants, this paper discusses a method by applying metadata modeling to the creation of views towards unstructured information related to building components, construction process or project management information. By using this method project participants may be able to quickly locate relevant information needed to understand and process a construction document such as an Request for Information (RFI). This study finds that by utilizing industry standards such as Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) it is technically feasible to develop such a method. However, further studies are needed to validate the idea and the system in practice. © 2006.

N2  - Speech is a fundamental means of human communication. Design and construction are social activities. We argue that designers and builders generate and develop concepts through dialogue. These communicative events are typically not captured. Consequently, knowledge transfer and reuse opportunities are missed. Our objective is to capture and mine rich, contextual, social communicative events for further knowledge reuse. We present a methodology and prototype called I-Dialogue that: (1) captures the knowledge generated during informal communicative events through dialogue, sketching and gestures in the form of unstructured digital design knowledge corpus; (2) adds structure to the unstructured digital knowledge corpus; and (3) processes the corpus using an innovative notion disambiguation algorithm in support of knowledge retrieval. The paper concludes with results of evaluation experiments with I-Dialogue using a testbed of design - construction projects. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2007.

N2  - In this paper we analytically compare the two widely accepted approaches of spoken document indexing, Position. Specific Posterior Lattices (PSPL) and Confusion Network (CN), in terms of retrieval accuracy and index size. The fundamental distinctions between these two approaches in terms of construction units, posterior probabilities, number of clusters, indexing coverage and space requirements are discussed in detail. A new approach to approximate subword posterior probability in a word lattice is also incorporated in PSPL/CN to handle OOV/rare word problems, which were unaddressed in original PSPL and CN approaches. Extensive experimental results on Chinese broadcast news segments indicate that PSPL offers higher accuracy than CN but requiring much larger disk space, while subword-based PSPL turns out to be very attractive because it lowers the storage cost while offers even higher accuracies. ©2007 IEEE.

N2  - The increasing importance of text-based information retrieval (IR) developments in the architecture, engineering, and construction industries (AEC) and the lack of sharable testing resources to support these developments call for an approach that can be used to generate domain-specific reference collections. To address this need, the authors investigated the characteristics of the testing environment in AEC and ways to adapt dominant collection preparation methods for the domain. This paper presents the authors' collection generation approach through the preparation process of the Taiwanese National Center for Research on Earthquake Engineering (NCREE) collection. The collection's Chinese-to-English translation instruments are also discussed as matching semantic/linguistic resources are highly valued in AEC's text-based IR developments. The paper also includes a use case for the NCREE collection to show how a collection generated by the proposed approach could be applied to support research experiment and validation. The direct outputs, the NCREE collection and its translation instruments, are sharable and reusable testing resources, while mechanisms for seeking collections from other researchers are part of the extended research endeavors. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Knowledge, particularly in the form of experience, can provide a competitive advantage in the construction industry. Knowledge organization (KO) systems developed in the library, information, and computer sciences are excellent for delivering knowledge services. However, it is difficult for these systems to judge how suitable (not just relevant) any of the retrieved knowledge will be in practice. This study puts forward a directional experience ontology (DExOntology) framework, which makes use of KO characteristics to set up problem-topic ontology, but augments the retrieved knowledge documents (KwDocs) in the knowledge bank with additional "orientation" from weighted, attributes determined by domain experts, thus bridging the gap between existing KO systems and practical, requirements. The goal is a mechanism, that delivers knowledge, especially in the domain of practical experience, more efficiently and effectively than simple information retrieval searches. The study finds that the DExOntology framework, significantly improves both the relevancy and suitability of the retrieved knowledge, making it a more useful system, for construction industry practitioners to use in the field. © 2008 NRC Canada.

N2  - Post Project Reviews (PPR) capture good and bad practices, identify problems, waste, risks, missed opportunities, communication lag, financial issues, partner relationships etc., of a construction project supply chain (CPSC). They are huge sources of information, knowledge and experience from project managers, clients, suppliers and contractors, related to issues from every stage of the construction project. If these reports were analysed collectively, they may expose important detail, perhaps repeated across a number of projects. However, because most companies do not have the resources to thoroughly examine these PPRs, either individually or collectively, important insights are missed thereby leading to missed opportunities to learn from previous projects. This research shows that the hidden knowledge and experiences could be captured using knowledge discovery and text mining approaches to uncover patterns, associations, and trends in PPRs. The results might then be used to address specific problem areas, enhance processes and improve the design and planning for new construction projects.

N2  - Post-Project Reviews (PPRs) are a rich source of knowledge and data for organisations - if organisations have the time and resources to analyse them. Too often these reports are stored, unread by many who could benefit from them. PPR reports attempt to document the project experience - both good and bad. If these reports were analysed collectively, they may expose important detail, e.g. recurring problems or examples of good practice, perhaps repeated across a number of projects. However, because most companies do not have the resources to thoroughly examine PPR reports, either individually or collectively, important insights and opportunities to learn from previous projects, are missed. This research explores the application of knowledge discovery techniques and Text Mining to uncover patterns, associations, and trends from PPR reports. The results might then be used to address problem areas, enhance processes, and improve customer relationships. A case study related to two construction companies is presented in this paper and knowledge discovery techniques are used to analyse 50 PPR reports collected during the last three years. The case study has been examined in six contexts and the results show that Text Mining has a good potential to improve overall knowledge reuse and exploitation. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - The paper advocates the use of a new fuzzy-based clustering algorithm for document categorization. Each document/datum will be represented as a fuzzy set. In this respect, the fuzzy clustering algorithm, will be constrained additionally in order to cluster fuzzy sets. Then, one needs to find a metric measure in order to detect the overlapping between documents and the cluster prototype (category). In this respect, we use one of the interclass probabilistic reparability measures known as Bhattacharyya distance, which will be incorporated in the general scheme of the fuzzy c-means algorithm for measuring the overlapping between fuzzy sets. This enables the introduction of fuzziness in the document clustering in the sense that it allows a single document to belong to more than one category. This is in line with semantic multiple interpretations conveyed by single words, which support multiple membership to several classes. Performances of the algorithms will be illustrated using a case study from the construction sector. © 2009 Operational Research Society Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Disagreements in construction projects often result in litigation that is both time-consuming and expensive. A dispute review board (DRB) provides a valuable and proven alternative method of dispute resolution. Currently, the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) stores DRB reports in portable document format (PDF) with limited search capability. Improving information retrieval of DRB documents and providing a certain level of integration of DRB reports with relevant but heterogeneous data and documents is the key to enhancing the current FDOT DRB system. This paper presents a web-based data management framework to improve information management processes of the FDOT DRB system by providing key features such as metadata generation, an integrated review process, a simple issue description, member information management, and versatile information search. The new system not only allows DRB members and FDOT construction engineers to store and retrieve DRB reports but also provides more functionality to process those reports. New functionalities include a structured search based on the metadata of DRB reports, an unstructured search using advanced computer technology, and the integration of DRB reports with other related information for analysis. This type of functionality improves the efficiency and effectiveness of the DRB system.

N2  - Quick and correct information capturing, archival and retrieval in construction sites is essential to support project management. This paper presents a new methodology for managing construction document information using RFID-based semantic contexts. The methodology deploys four main tools for construction document archival and retrieval: (1) template document metadata modules that formulate document information; (2) semantic ontologies for indexing construction documents; (3) RFID framework for automatic identification of construction concepts; and (4) an ontological indexing mechanism to reason about ontological semantic relationships and infer applicable concepts for indexing. To demonstrate the role and contribution of the new proposed methodology, first a template for construction problem documents module has been constructed. Then, a new object-oriented Java-based prototype was developed to leverage RFIDs and OWL (Web Ontology Language)-based ontologies for reasoning about indexed construction concepts. Finally, a case study has been performed to validate the new methodology's capability of supporting users through available RFID information in the selection of construction concepts for archiving and retrieving related, stored documents from a relational corporate database of construction problems. The new methodology implementation shows a number of direct impacts such as the effectiveness of document archival and retrieval and the efficiency of fusing information. The new methodology is described in the paper, including findings obtained from the case study and a discussion of future research. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - The construction industry consists of many unstructured documents, which accumulate a large volume of tacit knowledge. In the general domain, a Knowledge Map can illustrate connections of knowledge and transfer tacit knowledge to explicit knowledge, but this is unsuitable on specific domain such as construction industry. This research generalized existing mapping rules to be applied to general and specific domain; and presented a novel and practical model for building knowledge map, named Knowledge Map Model (KMM). This model comprised of five procedures, including identifying problems, discussing with experts and users, establishing the classification structure, establishing the document base, and deciding the display model. Furthermore, this research establishes Knowledge Map Model System (KMMS) as a major tool to improve the knowledge map reused and shared among the practical process. Finally, this research validated the KMM in a real project of bridge maintenance.

N2  - The objective of this research is to present an innovative technique for managing the knowledge contained in construction contract documents to facilitate quick access and efficient use of such knowledge for project management and contract administration tasks. Knowledge Management has become the focus of a lot of scientific research during the second half of the 20th century as researchers discovered the importance of the knowledge resource to business organizations. Despite early expectations of improved document management techniques, document management systems used in the construction industry have failed to deliver the anticipated performance. Recent research attempts to utilize analysis of the contents of documents to improve document categorization and retrieval functions. It is hypothesized that natural language processing can be effectively used to perform document text analysis. The proposed system, technique for concept relation identification using shallow parsing (CRISP), utilizes a shallow parser to extract semantic knowledge from construction contract documents which can be used to improve electronic document management functions such as document categorization and retrieval. When compared with human evaluators, CRISP achieved almost 80% of the average kappa score attained by the evaluators, and approximately 90% of their F -measure score. © 2010 ASCE.

N2  - This article presents the possibilities of using mining techniques in building Decision Support Systems. One of the biggest problems is the issue of gaining data and knowledge, their mutual representation and reciprocal usage. Data and knowledge make up the resources of the system and are its key link. It has been estimated that 70% to 80% of the sources available for general use are text documents. The text mining technique is defined as a process aiming to extract previously unknown information from text resources (e.g. technological cards). The fundamental feature of text mining is the ability to converse text documents in formal form, which opens up great possibilities of conducting further analysis. This article presents chosen IT tools using text mining technique, along with the elements of the text mining analysis. The main objectives are the simplification of the process of knowledge acquisition, its automation and shortening as well as the creation of ready-made models containing knowledge. Previous tests with knowledge acquisition (surveys, questionnaires) were time-consuming and exacting for experts.

N2  - The paper describes a methodology used to develop ontology for Low Carbon Domain, taking into account the wealth of existing semantic resources in the construction sector. The latter range from construction taxonomies to energy calculation tools and internal data structures (i.e. conceptual database schema). The paper argues that taxonomies provide an ideal backbone for any ontology project. Equally, textual documents have an important role in sharing and conveying knowledge and understanding. Therefore, a construction industry standard taxonomy (IFC) is used to provide the seeds of the ontology, enriched and expanded with additional concepts extracted from large construction sustainability and energy oriented document bases using information retrieval (tf-idf and Metric Clusters) techniques. The developed "SCrIPt (Sustainable Construction Service Platform)" ontology will be used as the semantic engine of the Sustainability Construction Portal, commissioned by the Welsh Assembly Government. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, London.

N2  - Taking the features of data in low and high frequency texts and the frequencies which such features emerge in a single text into consideration, the paper sets up a vector space model for part of texts of field. Then the paper also establishes a classifying and clustering method with features of classification and clustering by designing and constructing the two-dimensional analytic indexes of similarities and differences between field texts. This method is designed for field texts because it is quite suitable for effective machine learning and can extend the text data and textual categories dynamically in real-time. Meantime, it solves the single-label classification and multi-label classification issues at one time, overcoming the defects of previous text classifying methods which can only expand data instead of capacity. The general text clustering methods have many defects: they are not suitable for high-dimensional data sets or large data sets; they don't have the text data and category expanding function and they can not handle the outlier data problem well. On the contrary, this new method can offer solutions to these defects. According to this method, the corresponding algorithm has been established and the effectiveness of the method has been proven by the experiment on the data sets of laws and regulations of construction industry in Shaanxi Province in China. © 2010 IEEE.

N2  - This paper represents a step in a line of research aiming at mitigating the negative effects of conflicts on the construction industry through developing a construction legal decision support methodology. This step developed Support Vector Machine (SVM) models to automatically extract latent legal factors, upon which judges base their verdicts, from precedent cases. The adopted research methodology developed and compared the output of first, second, and third degree polynomial kernel SVM models while implementing 4 weighing mechanisms namely term frequency (tf), logarithmic term frequency (ltf), augmented term frequency (atf), and term frequency inverse document frequency (tf.idf). The models were trained and tested over two sets of Differing Site Condition (DSC) cases compiled from the Federal Court of New York. The two sets were composed of 120 and 450 cases respectively. The highest accuracy of extraction of 76% was attained using first degree polynomial kernel SVM while implementing tf.idf weighing with the first set. With the second set, a higher accuracy of 85% was achieved using third degree polynomial kernel SVM while implementing tf.idf weighing. Copyright ASCE 2010.

N2  - Documents that support design, construction and other stages of the life cycle of buildings and other facilities, as for example building standards and codes, can be considered as composed of parts that describe products, activities and/or services. Although in some cases non-textual means are employed (e.g. tables, diagrams, schemas), a significant part of the information contained in such documents is expressed through natural language sentences. In this paper, we present an approach to capture the semantics of textual activity-related information that can be used for information retrieval and knowledge management in the construction sector. This approach is based upon the general knowledge representation paradigm of semantic networks, and builds on previous work about the semantic modelling of product information. The paper describes the repertoire of representational means, concepts and semantic relations (or semantic roles), that are used for representing the semantics of activity-related information, and illustrates their use in a query-answer game that has as input documents semantically annotated according to the approach. Finally, we comment on the main characteristics of a Query-Answer System (QAS) that we are implementing for doing these tasks with ease. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, London.

N2  - Automated regulatory and contractual compliance checking in the construction domain requires automated complex processing, interpretation, and analysis of laws, regulations, and contractual terms, which are commonly expressed in textual documents. The first step in automating the text analysis process is automating text classification. For example, for contractual documents, automated text classification involves classification of different contractual clauses (or parts of clauses) into different groups (such as payment, material specifications, equipment specifications, green construction requirements, conflict resolution clauses, etc). This paper studies the different methods of text classification (a sub-field of natural language processing (NLP)). Text classification is the process of identifying the group to which a piece of text belongs. The process can be either supervised (human-guided) or unsupervised (completely automated). The paper discusses the applicability of both approaches. Different text classification methods such as naïve Bayes classifier, support vector machines, classification trees, and maximum entropy, are presented and analyzed in the context of construction contract text classification. The paper also introduces a prototype for classifying construction contractual clauses (and sub-clauses).

N2  - Construction documents are produced in various formats, some of which are structured like Autocad Drawings and Construction Schedules. However, it is fact that the majority of the construction knowledge is produced in unstructured formatted documents like technical specifications, meeting minutes, daily reports, claims, and construction litigation cases. With the current level of sophistication and integration of the construction industry, automated models that allow speedy classification, use, and re-use of the construction knowledge included in these documents became a necessity. Over the years, researchers in this field were faced with two major obstacles. Firstly, knowledge included in unstructured construction documents is presented in natural language. Secondly, these documents are lengthy and address several topics or different aspects of the same topic. Although researched in the field of Artificial Intelligence have focused and attained advancements in relation to the first obstacle, their success is hindered by the second. Consequently, this paper proposes an automated text segmentation methodology to alleviate the negative impact of the second obstacle. To that end, the proposed research methodology (1) gathered and utilized a corpus of 500 Different Site Conditions (DSC) cases from the Federal Court of New York; (2) developed a C++ algorithm to tokenize and parse the used cases; (3) implemented text segmentation methodology adopted from Hearst's TextTiling algorithm; and (4) evaluated the attained results against manually tagged cases. The outcomes of this research are expected to enhance automated document classification and decision support tools developed for the construction industry.

N2  - Large amounts of project documents are produced in a construction project. Unlike contract documents which are produced at the same time to finalize the contract, project documents are produced gradually throughout the life of the project. Accordingly, the processing of project documents is a continuous and gradual task performed almost on a daily basis. The majority of project documents are text documents containing unstructured information which from a document management perspective produces several problems such as increasing the difficulty level of information retrieval, creating interoperability issues between different systems and hindering information reuse. Another important aspect that characterizes construction project documents is that the documents are semantically interrelated. Project information on a certain event is recorded, disputed, revised and reiterated in various successive documents producing links between these documents. Ultimately, a knowledge discourse is generated that can only be represented by the aggregation of the information in the relevant documents, not just by the information contained in one document; a discourse that requires the application of cognitive skills by the information seeker to comprehensively deduce. The performance of an automatic text classifier based on latent semantic analysis (LSA) in identifying such relations between project documents is investigated. The results of the evaluation may offer important applications in electronic document management, information retrieval and, in general, knowledge sharing and reuse.

N2  - The dynamic nature of the construction industry yields enormous amount of documents that have to be stored, retrieved, and reused. Most of these documents are generated in an unstructured format. Therefore, in an attempt to provide a robust document classification methodology for the construction industry, the current research proposes an automated classifier model through Support Vector Machines (SVM). The adopted research methodology (1) gathered a corpus of documents including 300 correspondences, 150 meeting minutes, 25 claims, and 300 Differing Site Conditions (DSC) cases; (2) developed C++ algorithms which process unstructured documents into a readable format by the SVM algorithm; (4) developed 16 SVM automated classification models; and (5) tested and validated the developed models. The developed models under the current research attained higher accuracy, and better precision and recall than previous researches illustrated in the literature. The current research represents a continuation to previous researches performed within this realm. © 2011 ASCE.

N2  - The paper describes the "SCrIPt" methodology used to develop a sustainable construction domain ontology, taking into account the wealth of existing semantic resources in the construction sector. The latter range from construction taxonomies (e.g. IFCs) to energy calculation tools' internal data structures (i.e. conceptual database schema). The paper argues that taxonomies provide an ideal backbone for any ontology project. Equally, textual documents have an important role in sharing and conveying knowledge and understanding. Therefore, a construction industry standard taxonomy is used to provide the seeds of the ontology, enriched and expanded with additional concepts extracted from large construction sustainability and energy oriented document bases using information retrieval (tf-idf and Metric Clusters) techniques. The SCrIPt ontology will be used as the semantic engine for a Sustainability Construction Platform, commissioned by the Welsh Assembly Government in the UK. © 2011 ASCE.

N2  - Pursuing sustainable development has been considered the most critical issue in the future construction industry. Among the many approaches to achieve sustainable development, construction innovation provides one of the most promising and effective solutions. This paper presents the preliminary result of a recent research project on Automated Construction Iinnovation Model (ACTIM) that can generate innovative construction methods automatically with a novel approach that integrates a text mining technique, patent analysis, and Genetic Algorithm (GA). Previous technological information stored in the public patent databases is adopted as the knowledge repository for building the function model of the target construction method. It is then transformed into a genetic operation tree (GOT) for evolving with GA. Finally, the innovative solution is recovered as a function model and realized in a 3D model. An example of a road manhole construction technology is selected for illustration of the proposed ACTIM method. The preliminary results show that the proposed ACTIM provides a promising tool for construction engineers and managers to meet future challenges in achieving sustainable development. © The Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

N2  - Textual databases are useful sources of information and knowledge and if these are well utilised then issues related to future project management and product or service quality improvement may be resolved. A large part of corporate information, approximately 80%, is available in textual data formats. Text Classification techniques are well known for managing on-line sources of digital documents. The identification of key issues discussed within textual data and their classification into two different classes could help decision makers or knowledge workers to manage their future activities better. This research is relevant for most text based documents and is demonstrated on Post Project Reviews (PPRs) which are valuable source of information and knowledge. The application of textual data mining techniques for discovering useful knowledge and classifying textual data into different classes is a relatively new area of research. The research work presented in this paper is focused on the use of hybrid applications of text mining or textual data mining techniques to classify textual data into two different classes. The research applies clustering techniques at the first stage and Apriori Association Rule Mining at the second stage. The Apriori Association Rule of Mining is applied to generate Multiple Key Term Phrasal Knowledge Sequences (MKTPKS) which are later used for classification. Additionally, studies were made to improve the classification accuracies of the classifiers i.e. C4.5, K-NN, Naïve Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The classification accuracies were measured and the results compared with those of a single term based classification model. The methodology proposed could be used to analyse any free formatted textual data and in the current research it has been demonstrated on an industrial dataset consisting of Post Project Reviews (PPRs) collected from the construction industry. The data or information available in these reviews is codified in multiple different formats but in the current research scenario only free formatted text documents are examined. Experiments showed that the performance of classifiers improved through adopting the proposed methodology. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - The traditional way of construction project claim document production suffers from tediousness and inefficiency. The manual assembly of claim event history leads to poor reliability of the claim report, due to the claim knowledge gap between experts and clerks. Sharing the team's comprehensive and formal claim knowledge with all of the participants in the claim work flow would result in a more effective way of producing claim documents. This study proposes a system for the ontology-based automatic generation of construction claim documents. The system will extract claim knowledge from all the potential sources into ontology. Software agents supported by the ontology will then complete each part of the claim events history data collection and generation process. The system will also support other functions such as information retrieval, natural language processing and database management. Such a system would efficiently facilitate the claim documents work and become an effective assistant to claim experts. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.

N2  - Manual regulatory compliance checking of construction projects is usually timeconsuming and error-prone. There have been efforts both in academia and industry to automate this process. However, none of them achieved full automation. Specifically, the extraction of rules from regulatory text (e.g. building code) and its representation in a computer-processable format is still conducted manually or semi-automatically. Natural language processing (NLP) aims at enabling computers to process natural language text in a human-like manner. It provides basic concepts and methods for text processing and analysis, such as part of speech (POS) tagging, tokenization, sentence splitting, named entity recognition, and semantic role labeling, etc. This paper is intended to explore the effectiveness of utilizing syntactic (i.e. grammatical) and semantic (i.e. meaning descriptive) features of the text (using NLP tools and techniques) to automatically extract regulatory information from building codes. An automated information extraction (IE) approach - involving the use of IE rules - is proposed. Chapter 12 of the 2006 International Building Code was used to develop the IE rules, while Chapter 12 of the 2009 International Fire Code was used to test the approach. An overall F-measure of 0.94 shows the potential of the proposed approach. Based on the experimental results and their analysis, we conclude the paper by pinpointing possible ways for improving the proposed approach. © 2012 ASCE.

N2  - This paper brings a contribution focused on collaborative engineering projects where knowledge plays a key role in the process. Collaboration is the arena, engineering projects are the target, knowledge is the currency used to provide harmony into the arena since it can potentially support innovation and, hence, a successful collaboration. The building and construction domain is challenged with significant problems for exchanging, sharing and integrating information between actors. For example, semantic gaps or lack of meaning definition at the conceptual and technical level, are problems fundamentally created through the employment of representations to map the ‘world’ into models in an endeavour to anticipate different actors’ views, vocabulary, and objectives. One of the primary research challenges addressed in this work is the process of formalization and representation of document content, where most existing approaches are limited in their capability and only take into account the explicit, word-based information in the document. The research described in this paper explores how traditional knowledge representations can be enriched by incorporation of implicit information derived from the complex relationships (the Semantic Associations) modelled by domain ontologies combined with the information presented in documents, thereby providing a baseline for facilitating knowledge interpretation and sharing between humans and machines. The paper introduces a novel conceptual framework for representation of knowledge sources, where each knowledge source is semantically represented (within its domain of use) by a Semantic Vector. This work contributes to the enrichment of Semantic Vectors, using the classical vector space model approach extended with ontological support, employing ontology concepts and their relations in the enrichment process. The test bed for the assessment of the approach is the Building and Construction industry, using an appropriateB&CdomainOntology. Preliminary results were collected using a clustering algorithm for document classification, which indicates that the proposed approach does improve the precision and recall of classifications. Future work and open issues are also discussed. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.

N2  - Several important aspects characterize construction project documents. Large numbers of documents are produced in construction projects. The majority of the documents are unstructured textual documents. The production of documents is a gradual process that extends over the duration of the project. Documents, as information carriers, are an important repository of project knowledge. Project information is recorded, disputed, revised, and reiterated in various successive documents producing links between these documents and creating groups of semantically related documents within the project corpus. Despite the difficulties imposed on document management efforts by these characteristics, an electronic document management (EDM) approach must take into account these features in order to successfully manage project documents. In this study, a prototype electronic document management system (EDMS) that capitalizes on the various aspects that characterize project documents is presented. The system is based on the document discourse concept, which recognizes the semantic relations between groups of documents. The system also employs a text analysis feature which was evaluated for accuracy of classification based on document discourse and produced satisfactory results. The prototype system was evaluated using expert review. The main finding of the review recommends implementation of document discourse management as a module of an integrated project management system to achieve the best and most practical application. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

N2  - Construction project produces a large amount of unstructured information throughout the whole lifecycle, most of them is text information. Building information modeling (BIM) can support lifecycle information management of construction project, so BIM-based construction domain text information integration management can improve the efficiency and quality of project management to a large extent. The concept of BIM and its implementation platform, as well as the data exchange standard, i.e. industry foundation class (IFC), are introduced firstly. Then this paper puts forward a systematic unstructured construction domain text information management system framework, and the implementation of BIM-based text information integration methodology: the unstructured text information is transformed to structured information by means of text mining to facilitate information retrieval and ranking; then the text information is classified according to the IFC standard, and is associated with entities in BIM to realize the integration of text information and BIM. Finally, this paper takes contract document as an example for verification. The proposed method can improve text information management ability and efficiency of construction domain. © 2013 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.

N2  - Risk management is crucial for successful construction project management. Effective risk assessment can improve construction enterprises' competitiveness and profitability to a great extent. And the information of previous projects is a very precious resource and reference for construction project risk management. In order to facilitate project participants to query required information of previous projects among numerous project documents efficiently, this paper introduces ontology as the modeling approach for information exchange and puts forward a semantic retrieval method based on this ontology for construction project risk management. At first, this paper introduces the procedure of constructing risk domain ontology by means of seven footwork modeling method, then the methods of construction projects' document processing and querying sentences' expansion are presented. Finally, this paper put forward a semantic retrieval system based on construction project risk domain ontology which can correlate the ontology conceptual knowledge and the documents' content. Experimental results suggest that the proposed ontology-based semantic retrieval method can improve information's semantic expression ability and realize the intellectualization of construction project risk management. © 2013 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.

N2  - Construction-related occupations have very high smoking prevalence rates and are an identified priority population for efforts to promote cessation. This study sought to identify the smoking cessation supports and services which best suited this workforce group, and to identify gaps in reach of preventive health services. We performed qualitative text analysis on pre-existing conversations about smoking cessation among workers in this sector. The material appeared on a discussion forum about residential construction from 1998 and 2011. Roughly 250 unique user names appeared in these discussions. The qualitative analysis addressed knowledge, motivation, environmental influences, and positive and negative experiences with supports for cessation. Self-identified smokers tended to want to quit and described little social value in smoking. Actual quit attempts were attributed to aging and tangible changes in health and fitness. Peer-to-peer social support for cessation was evident. Advice given was to avoid cigarettes and smokers, to focus on personal skills, personal commitment, and the benefits of cessation (beyond the harms from smoking). Many discussants had received medical support for cessation, but behavioural counselling services appeared underutilized. Our findings support efforts toward more complete bans on workplace smoking and increased promotion of available behavioural support services among dispersed blue-collar workers. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

N2  - The computer aided design (CAD) document provides an effective communication medium, a legal contract document, and a reusable design case for a construction project. Due to technological advancements in CAD industry, the volume of CAD documents has been increased dramatically in the database of construction organizations. Traditional retrieval methods relied on textual naming and indexing schemes that require the designers (engineers and architects) to memorize in details the meta-information used to characterize the drawings. Such approaches easily overwhelmed the users' memory capability and thus caused low reusability of CAD documents. In this paper, a content-based text mining technique is adopted to extract the textual content of a CAD document into a characteristic document (CD), which can be retrieved with similarity matching using a Vector Space Model (VSM), so that the automated and expedited retrievals of CAD documents from vast CAD databases become possible. A prototype system, namely Content-based CAD document Retrieval System (CCRS), is developed to implement the proposed method. After preliminary testing with a CAD database with 2094 Chinese annotated CAD drawings collected from two real-world construction projects and a public engineering drawing database, the proposed CCRS is proven to retrieve all relevant CAD documents with relatively high precision when appropriate query is specified. Finally, three search strategies are recommended for the users to narrow down search scope while a target CAD document is desired. It is concluded that the proposed content-based text mining approach provides a promising solution to improve the current difficulty encountered in retrieval and reusability of vast CAD documents for the construction industry.

N2  - In this paper, text data from a sample of competitively bid California highway projects has been used to predict the likely level of cost overrun in construction projects. A text description of the project and the text of the five largest project line items were used as input. The text data were converted to numerical attributes using text-mining algorithms and singular value decomposition. Classification rules were produced using the Ridor (ripple down rules) classification algorithm. Results of the modeling effort showed that the text data could be used to gain insight into the likely level of project cost overrun. © Civil-Comp Press, 2013.

N2  - The occurrences of construction accidents can be reduced but cannot be avoided because of risky and uncertain nature of construction works. Construction accidents tend to cause serious damages, injuries, fatalities, and work interruptions, and provoke disputes among the involved parties. One useful means for resolving the dispute through alternative dispute resolution, instead of costly litigation, is to find similar accidents occurring in the past in the same jurisdiction and compare their similarities and differences. This paper introduces a research project on the effective retrieval of relevant historical cases from a case library using text mining techniques. Research issues in the text mining process, especially how to represent the unstructured textual cases by a structured term vector model, are investigated. It is concluded that natural language based case document retrieval is superior to the case-based reasoning from structured case collection and is more practical for implementation in a construction management information system. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Image processing is an effective tool for automated monitoring of construction projects. For the last decade, it has gained increasing acceptance in its application to progress monitoring, productivity analyses, and quality assurance. However, a notable downside exists in image processing, especially in outdoor applications such as construction project monitoring: image quality is heavily affected by ambient lighting conditions. Poor or undesirable lighting conditions produce substandard quality images, which generally lead to a high level of errors in the related image processing for information extraction. This paper presents error-correction methods that can improve the image processing results for construction progress monitoring in the postprocessing stage. The methods are applied in the postprocessing stage. The key idea behind the error-correction methods is the concept of priority to classify input images and project information into several categories based on data reliability and intelligently use the classified information for more accurate analyses of the project progress. Tests in real construction sites showed that these postprocessing methods significantly increased the accuracy of image processing-based construction progress monitoring. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

N2  - Risk management is significant for successful construction project management. Effective risk assessment can improve construction enterprises' competitiveness and profitability to a great extent. The information of previous projects is a very precious resource for construction project risk management. In order to facilitate project participants to query required information among numerous project documents efficiently, this paper introduces ontology as the modeling approach for information exchange and researches on semantic retrieval based on this ontology. After studying how to construct risk domain ontology using the seven-footwork modeling method first, this paper then researches on projects' document processing and querying sentences' expansion. Finally, this paper designs a semantic retrieval system framework based on construction project risk domain ontology and makes the ontology's conceptual knowledge and the documents' contents related, which can improve the information's semantic expression ability and realize the intellectualization of project risk management. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

N2  - The construction industry is known to be dangerous and is featured by fatal occupational hazards. Job Hazard Analysis (JHA) is a common approach to mitigate and control these occupational hazards. It analyzes major tasks in a construction activity, identifies all the potential task related hazards, and suggests means to reduce or avoid each potential hazard. Because every project is unique, an effective JHA must consider the conditions specific to the project instead of reusing previous JHAs directly. To this end, JHA requires the participation of experienced construction practitioners and becomes a time-consuming and brain-draining task. While expert involvement is necessary during JHA development, the authors would like to explore the possibility of leveraging existing construction safety resources in order to reduce the required human efforts. This paper presents an approach based on text classification to support the automation of JHA. It uses the CPWR construction solutions database as an example to demonstrate how text classification can be applied to match the database documents with predefined safety violation scenarios and identify potentially useful safety approaches. This paper also discusses how different strategies were tested to optimize the effectiveness of the proposed text classification approach. The results indicate that although some of the classification strategies cannot make obvious progress on the effectiveness, the effectiveness of the text classification without optimization is good enough to support JHA. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

N2  - Text data from a sample of competitively bid California highway projects have been analyzed and used to make a prediction of a construction projects likely level of cost overrun. A textual description of the project and the text of the two largest project line items were used as input. The text data were converted to numerical attributes using text-mining algorithms. Classification rules were produced using the Ridor classification algorithm. Results of the modeling effort showed that the text data provides useful information for predicting a projects outcome.

N2  - Site inspection is an important component of safety management system. In current practices, the inspectors evaluate the safety condition on a construction site with the assistance of a standardised checklist. However, the checklist emphasizes on evaluating the implementation of safety management system, but provides limited task-specific check items for assessing whether the individual construction tasks are conducted under safe condition and in a safe manner. To address this issue, the research presented in this paper aims to provide safety practitioners with comprehensive and task-specific safety information to promote effective risk identification and facilitate strategic risk control during site inspection. Specifically, this research first builds a project-specific safety information database, which stores potential risks and control measures for each construction task. The research team then develops a mobile decision support tool to retrieve information from the database and support safer decision-making on site. The tool supports users in two ways: one is to provide daily risk checklists and risk control strategies to guide step-by-step inspection alongside the project schedule; the other is to let users input any safety-related keywords during the safety inspection process and the tool returns relevant safety information by applying text mining algorithms. It is ongoing research. This paper presents an overall research framework and discusses the progress in developing safety database and data retrieval concepts. The outcome of the project will help enhance safety management practices and reduce possible risky working conditions on a construction site.

N2  - The dangers of the construction industry due to the risk of fatal hazards, such as falling from extreme heights, being struck by heavy equipment or materials, and the possibility of electrocution, are well known. The concept of Job Hazard Analysis is commonly used to mitigate and control these occupational hazards. This technique analyzes the major tasks in a construction activity, identifies all potential task-related hazards, and suggests safe approaches to reduce or avoid each of these hazards. In this paper, the authors explore the possibility of leveraging existing construction safety resources to assist JHA, aiming to reduce the level of human effort required. Specifically, the authors apply ontology-based text classification (TC) to match safe approaches identified in existing resources with unsafe scenarios. These safe approaches can serve as initial references and enrich the solution space when performing JHA. Various document modification strategies are applied to existing resources in order to achieve superior TC effectiveness. The end result of this research is a construction safety domain ontology and its underlying knowledge base. A user scenario is also discussed to demonstrate how the ontology supports JHA in practice. © 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - This paper discusses how text describing a construction project can be combined with numerical data to produce a prediction of the level of cost overrun using data mining classification algorithms. Modeling results found that a stacking model that combined the results from several classifiers produced the best results. The stacking ensemble model had an average accuracy of 43.72% for five model runs. The model performed best in predicting projects completed with large cost overruns and projects near the original low bid amount. It was found that a stacking model that used only numerical data produced predictions with lower precision and recall. A potential application of this research is as an aid in budgeting sufficient funds to complete a construction project. Additionally, during the planning stages of a project the research can be used to identify a project that requires increased scrutiny during construction to avoid cost overruns. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Web-based data mining is an emerging technology that is increasingly being applied in Decision Support Systems in many industries. The objectives of this study are to develop a Web-based text mining system specific to the building and construction industry for web content gathering, handling and analysis. An authoritative website in the housing industrialization field is chosen as a case on which to carry out this study by means of four steps, as follows. First, a web crawler module for gathering the original web articles has been constructed. Second, the web content processing module is used to parse the HTML tags and segment the text content of each page. Then, the relational database deployed in a cloud platform is used to store the processing result. Finally, the Vector Space Model and TF-IDF algorithm are used to represent articles and calculate the relationship among all the articles gained in the web crawler module. As the government issues the news and policies online continuously, it is possible for people to know the key points and trends embodied in these policies in time by way of the proposed text mining system. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

N2  - This study uses text mining techniques to analyze employment data posted over the internet. The objective is to identify knowledge areas, skills and expertise relevant to jobs in the construction industry. We utilized the fast growing online job search engines to understand the construction job market and employer expectations. Over 20,000 job advertisements were downloaded from various websites between Oct 14th 2012 and March 15th 2013. We developed a text mining method to identify derived job qualification information from the downloaded pages. The developed algorithm is capable to derive rules by automatically extracting statistically significant patterns present inside preselected qualifications. The selection rules can then be used to detect the presence of these qualifications in new pages. Once the qualifications are identified, we used the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model to identify groups of skills that are required by employers. One of the major advantages of implementing LDA model is that it is an unsupervised approach and no training is needed. The algorithm was applied to a case study as an illustrative example. © 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license.

N2  - In order to improve the usage of construction documents and facilitate communication and cooperation among the participants to enhance project management, this paper presents a method of classifying the semi-structured and unstructured Chinese documents which are produced during the project lifecycle. It is combined with the commonly used IFC standard based on the analysis of the characteristics of construction project management. This paper conducts a similarity computing between the entities of the IFC standard and the Chinese documents by means of a space vector model and cosine similarity algorithm in order to realize the standardized classification of the Chinese documents. The case study proves the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

N2  - Many steel-based cities in China were established between the 1950s and 1960s. After more than half a century of development and boom, these cities are starting to decline and industrial transformation is urgently needed. This paper focuses on evaluating the transformation capability of resource-based cities building an evaluation model. Using Text Mining and the Document Explorer technique as a way of extracting text features, the 200 most frequently used words are derived from 100 publications related to steel- and other resource-based cities. The Expert Evaluation Method (EEM) and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) techniques are then applied to select 53 indicators, determine their weights and establish an index system for evaluating the transformation capability of the pillar industry of China's steel-based cities. Using real data and expert reviews, the improved Fuzzy Relation Matrix (FRM) method is applied to two case studies in China, namely Panzhihua and Daye, and the evaluation model is developed using Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation (FCE). The cities' abilities to carry out industrial transformation are evaluated with concerns expressed for the case of Daye. The findings have policy implications for the potential and required industrial transformation in the two selected cities and other resource-based towns. © 2015 Li et al.

N2  - The construction industry has adopted control measures of electrical hazards for decades, however construction workers are still electrocuted in the workplace every year. This problem leads to a need for assessing the quality of control measures. The goal of this study is to assess the control measures of electrical hazards using a perspective of hierarchy of controls (HOC). HOC counts control measures of five levels in descending effectiveness, which are Elimination, Substitution, Engineering, Administration, and Personal protective equipment. This study uses mixed methods of narrative text analysis and statistical analysis in examining 486 NIOSH recommended controls from fatality investigations. Findings reveal that behavioral controls remain prevalent in electrical hazard mitigation even though the knowledge of construction safety and health has increased in the past decades. This study also finds that effectiveness of controls is not statistically different by construction type nor occupation. Proposing a solution, the authors suggest that construction managers strictly stick to HOC rules by giving priority to higher level of controls and highly recommend that the U.S. construction industry leverage its prevention strategy by embracing more technological innovations and incentivizing prevention through design. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - This paper addresses the problem of automatic concept detection in a construction project documentation with the aim of increasing the efficiency of information retrieval for all stakeholders in real-time in cases when documents lack previously defined metadata or when the semantic knowledge is not taken into account. Introduction of significant concepts, in a user-specific problem domain would improve retrieval of relevant documents. Concepts, represented as word pairs, were ranked by using different statistical measures for semantic similarity in order to compare the observed and the expected co-occurrence under a null model. Experiments suggested that using the statistical measures in different combinations yielded better performance when compared to their individual usage. The proposed approach was tested on several data sets compiled from the documents originating from a smelting project in Bor in the Republic of Serbia. Common information retrieval measures, precision and recall, were calculated for different combinations of word span, context scope and applied statistical measures, and further discussed taking into account the complexity and specificity of the observed construction project documentation. ©Civil-Comp Press, 2015.

N2  - To fully automate regulatory compliance checking of construction projects, regulatory requirements need to be automatically extracted from various construction regulatory documents and then transformed into a formalized format that enables automated reasoning. To address this need, the authors propose an approach for automatically extracting information from construction regulatory textual documents and transforming them into logic clauses that could be directly used for automated reasoning. This paper focuses on presenting the proposed information transformation (ITr) methodology and the corresponding algorithms. The proposed ITr methodology utilizes a rule-based, semantic natural language processing (NLP) approach. A set of semantic mapping (SeM) rules and conflict resolution (CoR) rules are used to enable the automation of the transformation process. Several syntactic text features (captured using NLP techniques) and semantic text features (captured using an ontology) are used in the SeM and CoR rules. A bottom-up method is leveraged to handle complex sentence components. A consume and generate mechanism is proposed to implement the bottom-up method and execute the SeM rules. The proposed ITr algorithms were tested in transforming information instances of quantitative requirements, which were automatically extracted from the International Building Code 2009, into logic clauses. The algorithms achieved 98.2 and 99.1% precision and recall, respectively, on the testing data. © 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

N2  - This paper introduces a novel conceptual framework to support the creation of knowledge representations based on enriched semantic vectors, using the classical vector space model approach extended with ontological support. This work is focused on collaborative engineering projects where knowledge plays a key role in the process. Collaboration is the arena, engineering projects are the target and knowledge is the currency used to provide harmony into the arena since it can potentially support innovation and, hence, a successful collaboration. The test bed for the assessment of the approach comes from the Building and Construction sector, which is challenged with significant problems for exchanging, sharing and integrating information among actors. Semantic gaps or lack of meaning definition at the conceptual and technical levels, for example, are problems fundamentally originated through the employment of representations to map the 'world' into models in an endeavour to anticipate other actors' views, vocabulary and even motivations. One of the primary research challenges addressed in this work relates to the process of formalization and representation of document contents, where most existing approaches are limited and only take into account the explicit, word-based information in the document. The research described in this paper explores how traditional knowledge representations can be enriched through incorporation of implicit information derived from the complex relationships (semantic associations) modelled by domain ontologies with the addition of information presented in documents, by providing a baseline for facilitating knowledge interpretation and sharing between humans and machines. Preliminary results were collected using a clustering algorithm for document classification, which indicates that the proposed approach does improve the precision and recall of classifications. Future work and open issues are also discussed. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - Organizing construction project documents based on semantic similarities offers several advantages over traditional metadata criteria, including facilitating document retrieval and enhancing knowledge reuse. In this study, the use of text classifiers for automatically classifying documents according to their corresponding group of semantically related documents is evaluated. Supporting documents of claims were used as representations of document discourses. The evaluation was performed under varying general conditions (such as dimensionality level and weighting method) to assess the effect of such conditions on performance, and varying classifier-specific parameters. The highest performance in terms of classification accuracy was achieved by a Rocchio classifier and a kNN classifier with the application of dimensionality reduction and using the tf-idf weighting method. A combined classifier approach was also evaluated in which the classification outcome is based on a majority vote strategy between the outcomes of three different classifiers. The evaluation demonstrated that classification accuracy of standard text classifiers can be refined by applying an appropriate level of dimensionality reduction to the training and testing sets and by combining the results of several classifiers. Accordingly, such application enables effective utilization of standard text classifiers for automatic organization of project documents based on text content. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

N2  - Knowledge Management became the focus of scientific study during the second half of the 20th century. Unstructured data in project management documents hold critical and time-based information about how the project is going-on. However, retrieving useful information from this data is still challenging task. The proposed approach presents a Naïve Bayes text mining approach to identify early warnings of failure in a project lifecycle in advance. The paper focused on a construction industry project to analyse the effectiveness of this approach. Hence, the primary focus of this research was to identify the lack of various project management aspects. The implemented system scanned critical management documents including Minutes of meeting to identify these so-called early warnings. The technique was evaluated against unseen Meeting Minutes PDF files labelled via expert feedback. The system reported 80.43% of the identified early warnings to be lack of onsite materials followed by lack of keen commitment to project milestones and lack of staff skills and training. © 2015 IEEE.

N2  - Automated environmental compliance checking requires automated extraction of rules from environmental regulatory textual documents such as energy conservation codes and EPA regulations. Automated rule extraction requires complex text processing and analysis for information extraction and subsequent formalization of the extracted information into computer-processable rules. In the proposed automated compliance checking (ACC) approach, the text is first classified into predefined categories before information extraction (IE). The advantages are that irrelevant text will be filtered out during text classification (TC) and text with similar semantic meaning will be grouped, thereby improving the efficiency and accuracy of further IE and compliance reasoning (CR). The categories used for TC are predefined in a semantic TC topic hierarchy, and the classified text is subsequently used in semantic IE and semantic CR. This paper presents the proposed machine learning (ML)-based TC algorithm for classifying clauses in environmental regulatory documents based on the TC topic hierarchy. In developing the algorithm, different text preprocessing techniques, ML algorithms, and performance improvement strategies were tested and used. The final TC algorithm was tested on 10 environmental regulatory documents and evaluated in terms of precision and recall. The algorithm achieved approximately 97 and 84% average recall and precision, respectively, on the testing data. © 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

N2  - Field inspection is a common approach to the prevention of on-site accidents in the construction industry, which aims to identify and correct violations before they result in accidents. While conducting a field inspection, quite often safety professionals need to consult applicable construction safety standards. By doing so, they can make informed judgments on the violations and reference applicable standards. Text classification (TC) can be used to classify safety standards based on the types and causes of violations. Safety professionals can therefore use violation types and causes as indices to quickly locate applicable standards. Defining TC categories (or labels) is the first important step in performing TC, because satisfactory results cannot be achieved without appropriate TC categories. Researchers often determine applicable TC categories based on the important topics within a knowledge domain. However, not all TC categories can yield satisfactory TC results because some of them are not associated with strong and specific keywords that can be identified by text classifiers. This paper proposes a methodology with two strength measures for evaluating the appropriateness of candidate TC categories. The measures were tested on two alternative sets of candidate categories that were drafted for supporting construction field inspections. The results showed that the measures could accurately predict the relative TC performance and the satisfaction levels (satisfactory or unsatisfactory) of TC categories. Beyond the construction domain, this research provides a generalized procedure for evaluating the strength of candidate TC categories. © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - The mining methods are classified as the methods of data analysis and the knowledge acquisition and they are derived from the methods of "Knowledge Discovery". Within the scope of these methods, there are two main variants associated with a form of data, i.e.: "data" and "text mining". The author of the paper tries to find an answer to a question about helpfulness and usefulness of these methods for the purpose of knowledge acquisition in the construction industry. The very process of knowledge acquisition is essential in terms of the systems and tools operating based on knowledge. Nowadays, they are the basis for the tools which support the decision-making processes. The paper presents three cases studies. The mining methods have been applied to practical problems - the selection of an adhesive mortar coupled with alternative solutions, analysis of residential real estate locations under construction by a developer company as well as support of technical management of a building facility with a large floor area. © 2016 Polish Academy of Sciences.

N2  - Automated regulatory compliance checking requires automated extraction of requirements from regulatory textual documents and their formalization in a computer-processable rule representation. Such information extraction (IE) is a challenging task that requires complex analysis and processing of text. Natural language processing (NLP) aims to enable computers to process natural language text in a human-like manner. This paper proposes a semantic, rule-based NLP approach for automated IE from construction regulatory documents. The proposed approach uses a set of pattern-matching-based IE rules and conflict resolution (CR) rules in IE. A variety of syntactic (syntax/grammar-related) and semantic (meaning/context-related) text features are used in the patterns of the IE and CR rules. Phrase structure grammar (PSG)-based phrasal tags and separation and sequencing of semantic information elements are proposed and used to reduce the number of needed patterns. An ontology is used to aid in the recognition of semantic text features (concepts and relations). The proposed IE algorithms were tested in extracting quantitative requirements from the 2009 International Building Code and achieved 0.969 and 0.944 precision and recall, respectively. © 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

N2  - In the United States like in many other countries throughout the globe, construction workers are more likely to be injured on the job than workers in any other industry. This poor safety performance is responsible for huge human and financial losses and has motivated extensive research. Unfortunately, safety improvement in construction has decelerated in the last decade and traditional safety programs have reached saturation. Yet major construction companies and federal agencies possess a wealth of empirical knowledge in the form of huge databases of digital construction injury reports. This knowledge could be used to better understand, predict, and prevent the occurrence of construction accidents. Unfortunately, due to the lack of a clear methodology and the high costs of manual large-scale content analysis, these valuable data have yet to be extracted and leveraged. Recently, researchers have proposed a framework allowing meaningful empirical data to be extracted from accident reports. However, the resource limitations inherent to manual content analysis still remain. The present study tested the proposition that manual content analysis of injury reports can be eliminated using natural language processing (NLP). This paper describes (1) the overall strategy and methodology used in developing the system, and specifically how key challenges with decoding unstructured reports were overcome; (2) how the system was built through an iterative process of coding and testing against manual content analysis results from a team of seven independent analysts; and (3) the implications and potential uses of the data extracted. The results indicate that the NLP system is capable of quickly and automatically scanning unstructured injury reports for 101 attributes and outcomes with over 95% accuracy. The main contribution of this research is to empower any organization to quickly obtain a large and highly reliable structured attribute and outcome data set from their databases of unstructured accident reports. Such structured data are a necessary prerequisite to the application of statistical modeling techniques, allowing the extraction of new safety knowledge and finally the amelioration of safety management. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - During a construction project, it is important to ensure that accurate and pertinent knowledge is delivered on time to appropriate personnel. The criticality of documents exchanged or referred to by various parties, evolves over the course of the project life cycle. Determining the criticality of documents at different stages of the project can aid companies with managing the flow of information in an organized manner, while providing for the detection of potentially disruptive, erroneous material that could result in delays and costs. Therefore, it is crucial to determine documents that have the potential to disrupt a process, so that they may be prevented from entering or interfering with the active flow of information in a project. Electronic product and process management (EPPM) systems provide the capability to establish and map information flow between different parties in a construction project. Analyzing an EPPM system may yield information about the criticality of certain documents within an activity, as well as isolate characteristics peculiar to documents, which can assist in risk mitigation. A methodology is proposed to identify such critical documents. Four factors were identified based upon metadata, structure, and historical data recorded for documents within an EPPM system to determine the criticality of documents over a construction project life cycle. The factors and a combined score were calculated for a model project scenario-based simulation within a full-scale EPPM system and anticipated problematic documents were identified. It was therefore functionally demonstrated that determining critical construction documents via document metadata and access history records is feasible and may contribute to both industry and the academic body of knowledge for document classification. © 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

N2  - In building information modeling (BIM), the model is a digital representation of physical and functional characteristics of a facility and contains enriched product information pertaining to the facility. This information is generally embedded into the BIM model as properties for parametric building objects, and is exchangeable among project stakeholders and BIM design programs - a key feature of BIM for enhancing communication and work efficiency. However, BIM itself is a purpose-built, product-centric information database and lacks domain semantics such that extracting construction-oriented quantity take-off information for the purpose of construction workface planning still remains a challenge. Moreover, some information crucial to construction practitioners, such as the topological relationships among building objects, remains implicit in the BIM design model. This restricts information extraction from the BIM model for downstream analyses in construction. To address identified limitations, this study proposes an ontology-based semantic approach to extracting construction-oriented quantity take-off information from a BIM design model. This approach allows users to semantically query the BIM design model using a domain vocabulary, capitalizing on building product ontology formalized from construction perspectives. As such, quantity take-off information relevant to construction practitioners can be readily extracted and visualized in 3D in order to serve application needs in the construction field. A prototype application is implemented in Autodesk Revit to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed new approach in the domain of light-frame building construction. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Extracting critical sections from project management documents is a challenging process and an active area of research. Project management documents contain certain earlywarnings that, ifmodelled properly, may inform the project planners and managers in advance of any impending risks via early warnings. Extraction of such indicators from documents is termed as text mining, which is an active area of research. In the context of construction project management, extraction of semantically crucial information from documents is a challenging task that can in turn be used to provide decision support by optimising the entire project lifecycle. This research presents a two-step modelling and clustering methodology. It exploits the capability of a Naïve Bayes classifier to extract early warnings from management text data. In the first step, a database corpus is prepared via a qualitative analysis of expertly fed questionnaire responses. In the latter stage a Naïve Bayes classifier is proposed which evaluates real-world construction management documents to identify potential risks based on certain keyword usages. The classifier outcome was compared against labelled test documents and gave an accuracy of 68.02 %, which is better than the majority of text mining algorithms reported in the literature. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

N2  - Even engineers who have the same job title and are working on the same project have different skills and backgrounds. However, despite the importance of assigning the right person to the right job to ensure successful project delivery, current human resource (HR) allocation practices are only concerned with the list of projects in which a candidate has been involved, years of experience in a discipline, and their previous job titles. As a result, some engineers lack the knowledge and experience to perform the tasks they are assigned on a project. This study demonstrates the need for a long, descriptive résumé rather than the commonly used short, brief résumé. When the job candidates who participated in this study were asked to describe their work experience in several sentences on their curriculum vitae (CV) instead of describing them using a few words composed of just the job title and roles, the contents of the CVs were clearer and showed less bias. This paper therefore presents a text-mining algorithm and a semantic résumé analysis system that we developed to automatically extract and analyze the work experience candidates write about on their résumés. This algorithm and analysis system can help HR managers control the significant amount of information found on prospective employees' long résumés. To validate the algorithm and the system, six sample résumés were collected anonymously. These résumés were then reviewed both manually and by the developed system. In a subsequent study, we expect to apply the text mining-based HR resource allocation algorithm to select construction engineers for a real project and measure the job-matching rate.

N2  - Background: With the rising adoption of Building Information Modeling (BIM) in the AEC sector, computational models supersede traditional ways of information provision based on textual documents and two-dimensional drawings. The use of models enables the streamlining of workflows, and the included virtual construction increases the quality of the final product, the building. To create a comprehensive description of a planned building, information from different sources must be combined, specified and regularly updated by the project’s stakeholders. The emerging models are highly structured, and instance files entail large amounts of data. However, in an unprocessed state, these models are of limited suitability for performing engineering tasks as the amount and structure does not match the domain-specific and purpose-oriented views. Methods: Selection and filtering data for the user’s needs is a well-understood task in computer science, and various approaches are available. A promising approach is the usage of formal query languages. In this paper, selected common query languages are examined and assessed for processing building model information. Based on the analysis, we come to the conclusion that textual query languages are too complex to be employed by typical end users in the construction industry such as architects and engineers. Results: To overcome this issue, two Visual Programming Languages representing a new, more intuitive mechanism for data retrieval are introduced. The first one, QL4BIM, is designed for general filtering of IFC models, the second one, VCCL, has been developed for Code Compliance Checking. Both languages provide operators based on the Relational Algebra to allow handling of relations - a highly required feature of BIM QLs. Conclusions: The paper concludes with a discussion of the strengths and limitations of visual programming languages in the BIM context. © 2017, The Author(s).

N2  - A project discussion network is a space where project stakeholders form relationships among each other and share information about the project. Virtual discussion networks may refer to networks of e-mails, document exchange and social media (such as Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, etc.). As such, both social linkages and semantics of the exchanged content must be considered in analysis of such networks. The proposed framework in this study aims to analyze both the social and semantic aspects of these networks. We developed the framework through analysis of the social networks formed around Twitter accounts of infrastructure megaprojects. To assure relevance to construction research and practices, three objectives guided our analysis: relaying on a large and diversified data corpus from construction projects; testing the applicability and usage of a set of relevant algorithms to the context of construction project management; and linking the results of data analysis and algorithm evaluation to the conditions of construction projects at hand. In examining algorithms for detecting sub-communities, the Louvain fast unfolding modularity maximization was more suitable in detecting project relevant sub-groups. For assessing the relative influence of actors, PageRank algorithm performed better than centrality measures. For extracting key terms, we found that modifying the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) measure to incorporate the relative importance of the source nodes enhances the relevance of extracted terms. Obliviously, Twitter networks are only one type of project networks that can cover a limited/biased sample of participants. Their analysis should be one component of the overall project network analysis. We believe that the proposed framework has the same level of applicability to internal networks of project teams as well as non-Twitter networks. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Learning from past accidents is fundamental to accident prevention. Thus, accident and near miss reporting are encouraged by organizations and regulators. However, for organizations managing large safety databases, the time taken to accurately classify accident and near miss narratives will be very significant. This study aims to evaluate the utility of various text mining classification techniques in classifying 1000 publicly available construction accident narratives obtained from the US OSHA website. The study evaluated six machine learning algorithms, including support vector machine (SVM), linear regression (LR), random forest (RF), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), decision tree (DT) and Naive Bayes (NB), and found that SVM produced the best performance in classifying the test set of 251 cases. Further experimentation with tokenization of the processed text and non-linear SVM were also conducted. In addition, a grid search was conducted on the hyperparameters of the SVM models. It was found that the best performing classifiers were linear SVM with unigram tokenization and radial basis function (RBF) SVM with uni-gram tokenization. In view of its relative simplicity, the linear SVM is recommended. Across the 11 labels of accident causes or types, the precision of the linear SVM ranged from 0.5 to 1, recall ranged from 0.36 to 0.9 and F1 score was between 0.45 and 0.92. The reasons for misclassification were discussed and suggestions on ways to improve the performance were provided. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - The construction bidding process takes place in the early stages of a construction project. The bidding process involves many uncertainties since the construction risk factors are predicted and reflected in the bid price before construction commences. Therefore, bidders should thoroughly understand the uncertainty factors of the project before make bidding decisions. The uncertainty risk of construction projects is determined by the content that is contained in the bidding document. If the information provided in the bidding document is not accurate and is unclear, the uncertainty of the projects increases. Thus, this study is performed to predict risks in the bidding process of construction projects by analyzing the uncertainty of the bidding document and using it as factors to predict a project's bidding risk. To achieve this, bidding risk prediction modeling was conducted using the pre-bid clarification information of each project. In addition, text mining on pre-bid RFI documents, which are in an unstructured text data format, was performed and the results of text mining were used as major influencing factors for the risk prediction models. As a result, the accuracy of the risk prediction model including text data was improved (72.92%) when compared to the prediction model using only numeric data (52.08%). The results of this study are expected to strengthen the possibility of further similar studies in the future since it enhances the predictive accuracy by incorporating the uncertainty of the bidding document, which is rarely considered in previous studies. © 2017 by the authors.

N2  - Existing automated compliance checking (ACC) systems are limited in their automation; they rely on the use of hard-coded, proprietary rules for representing regulatory requirements, which requires major manual effort in extracting regulatory information from textual regulatory documents and coding these information into a rule format. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a new unified ACC system that integrates: (1) semantic natural language processing techniques and EXPRESS data-based techniques to automatically extract and transform both regulatory information (in regulatory documents) and design information [in building information models (BIMs)] for automated compliance reasoning, and (2) semantic logic-based information representation so that the reasoning could be fully automated. To test the proposed system, a BIM test case was checked for compliance with Chapter 19 of the International Building Code 2009. Comparing to a manually-developed gold standard, 98.7% recall and 87.6% precision in noncompliance detection were achieved. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - The ever increasing need for extracting knowledge from heterogeneous data has become a major concern. This is particularly observed in many application domains where several actors, with different expertise, exchange a great amount of information at any stage of a large-scale project. In this paper, we propose LinkedMDR: a novel ontology for Linked Multimedia Document Representation that describes the knowledge of a heterogeneous document corpus in a semantic data network. LinkedMDR combines existing standards and introduces new components that handle the connections between these standards and augment their capabilities. It is generic and offers a pluggable layer that makes it adaptable to different domain-specific knowledge. Experiments conducted on construction projects show that LinkedMDR is applicable in real-world scenarios. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.

N2  - —This paper presents a method for the automatical detection of similarities in CAD-models. The main concept is the possible transition of proprietary engineering parts of all kinds of software into the non-native VRML-file format that completely contains the geometrical information. The whole procedure can be divided in three subsections. At first an information extraction takes place. The geometry of the transferred VRML-model gets analyzed where especially the surface structure is extracted for the further processing in the next steps. The algorithm recognizes the shape of every involved face and delivers this information to the conditioning in the second step. There the gained data is used for the generation of graph-structure-like fingerprints that display all surface types as well as their in between connections. These can be considered as signatures, which contain the most important information in a condensed way. In the further steps it is intended to compare the CAD-parts with each other in order to find similarities, build clusters and form groups of topologically related geometries. For a powerful algorithmic comparison a further simplification is necessary. This is implemented by a translation of the graphical fingerprint into a text format and the removal of all smaller and non determining surfaces. Thus, topologically identical and also similar CAD-parts can be recognized and sorted into the same cluster. Due to the fact that the whole procedure is based on the analysis of text, it is qualified for a comparison of several engineering parts as well as for huge amounts of data, like for instance in construction companies. © 2017 IEEE.

N2  - Industry classification has served as an important tool for sector analysis in capital market research. Most of the existing classification schemes that are commonly used in academia or industry research require human input in the process of its design and construction. Because compilation and maintenance of such schemes demand comprehensive domain knowledge, it is highly costly and exhaustively time-consuming to update them to correctly reflect the fast-changing trends of the market. In addition, due to its subjective nature, interpretability is limited. As a remedy to such shortcomings, this paper adds to our earlier work, Business Text Industry Classification (BTIC) and proposes a new classification scheme, Business Text Industry Network (BTIN), namely, that automatically produces industry groupings based on the textual information from the corporate disclosures and news articles. BTIN exploits the business section of the Form 10-Ks, in which firms describe their business identities in a rich context, as well as the contents of news articles, which represent market perception of the subject firm. We employ Doc2vec for document embedding and a novel news curation algorithm to represent the relationship among firms in a graph structure, and then apply Louvain method to detect communities or, industries from the network and categorize firms into BTIN groups. Evaluation results using market ratios show that BTIN performs quite competitively against SIC, GICS, and its predecessor, BTIC, in terms of clustering fitness, inter-industry heterogeneity, and intra-industry homogeneity. © 2017 IEEE.

N2  - Projects, in the construction industry, involve the exchange of a large amount of information between several actors having different expertise and interests. Most of this information is unstructured, originated from different sources and dispersed across heterogeneous documents, thus producing implicit and explicit dependencies between them. This becomes very critical as it makes the annotation of the documents and the information retrieval more challenging at any stage of a building life cycle. In this work, we propose LinkedMDR: a novel ontology for Linked Multimedia Document Representation. Our ontology is based on the integration of the three standards addressing metadata and content representation: Dublin Core (DC), Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), and Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG-7) together with the addition of new components offering more features especially in representing the collective knowledge of a document corpus. LinkedMDR is generic and offers, as well, a pluggable layer handling the particularities of a domain-specific knowledge. Experiments measure the efficiency and the effectiveness of our solution in comparison with the existing standards. © 2017 INFORSID. All rights reserved.

N2  - Through the field investigation of 33 construction enterprises in different regions of China and the survey of 171 construction project managers, a total of 179 morbid appearance information texts were obtained in the decision stage. The clustering analysis of the 179 illusory representations was carried out by using the text clustering technique, and the classification results were obtained. On this basis, the mapping relationship between the illusory representation and the nature of the project management problem was explored, and the feature elements table was obtained. The results show that the text clustering technology has significant superiority in the pretreatment of the ill-posed information of the project, which is of great practical value for the project manager to deal with the problems in the engineering project in time.

N2  - Project risks must be managed to deliver construction projects on time and within budget. In recent years, the New Engineering Contract (NEC) provides an alternate contracting method for procuring construction projects. As stipulated in the NEC contract, NEC risk register must be used to record any project risks. The risk register is designed to record each risk item in the context of textual description, likelihood, and consequence. However, it is time-consuming to identify, quantify, and analyse NEC project risks based on experience, questionnaire, simulation, and data-mining approach. Any method to fully utilise the records of NEC risk registers of past projects for managing NEC project risks remains unexplored. As such, a data-driven approach is proposed to categorise common risks of NEC projects and to analyse risk rating of risk categories by combining the use of text mining analysis and decision tree analysis. A practical case study in Hong Kong is used to illustrate the method of application. The top four common types of NEC project risks, which are ground and utilities, design information, structures, and workmanship, were identified, quantified, and analysed. The new approach helps NEC project planners to identify, quantify, and analyse NEC project risks time-efficiently. © 2018 The Author(s).

N2  - Acquiring timely and proper information of host countries is a crucial element to lead successful and lucrative delivery of international construction projects. This information, however, commonly exists in forms of unstructured text data such as news articles and reports, which calls for the need of text mining. The aim of this research is to develop a prototype of construction document management system for global contract, which provides the user-needed information in a timely manner. The system named UNI (User Needed Information)-Tacit collects text data containing the recent information of the global construction market by using the web crawling algorithm, automatically allocates tags for each document with the most representative keywords based on Natural Language Processing, and eventually visualizes the results in the form of word clouds. The developed system, the survey validated its usefulness, is expected to contribute to collecting and organizing the latest issues on the global construction market, which provides better understanding of the target countries for decision makers. © 2018, Korean Society of Civil Engineers.

N2  - Conflicts in construction projects have always been a major problem. Unless an alternate resolution mechanism is spelled out in the contract, these disputes are typically resolved in court, which might be time consuming and financially substantial. This paper represents a continuation in a research focused on creating robust methodologies for legal decision support within the construction industry. Consequently, this papers tackles the problem of automating the extraction of implicit knowledge about significant legal factors upon which verdicts of Differing Site Condition (DSC) litigations are based. To that end, the research methodology (1) utilized a set of 600 cases from the Federal Court of New York; (2) adopted 15 legal concepts that have been found to be statistically significant for DSC litigations; (3) implemented 4 weighing mechanism for data representation, namely Term Frequency, Logarithmic Term Frequency, Augmented Term Frequency, and Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency; and (4) employed Machine Learning (ML) classifiers, namely Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, and PART for the development of 12 prediction models. Among the finding of this study (1) ML classifiers present a suitable solution for the analyzed task; and (2) Naïve Bayes classifiers achieved the highest prediction accuracy of 88%. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - The Ministry of Employment and Labor releases its annual report on the present conditions of industrial disasters by aggregating and summarizing negligent accidents that occur at construction sites. Industry-specific accident and fatality rates, and disaster classification and statistics are aggregated in this report, but its effectiveness is low. This is due to the fact that it does not sufficiently present the direct causes of accidents or related information on their causal relation. However, this study utilizes a big-data method that has recently gained significant attention throughout all industrial and academic areas to collect Internet articles on fire-accidents that have occurred at construction sites over the last decade. In addition, principal component analysis was conducted to deduce season-specific factors according to time, location, inducer, and accident pattern. Based on this analysis, as for common factors, direct spark and oil mist were deduced. As work-related factors, negligent supervision and violations of the safety regulations were shown to cause fire-accidents, illustrating the man-made nature of such accidents. It was also found that secondary accidents such as collapses, burials, explosions, and suffocation have occurred when fires have broken out. The big-data analysis method utilized in this study is considered to be very effective and can be successfully utilized in the future for deducing high volumes of text data. © 2018, Korean Society of Civil Engineers.

N2  - China's urban rail transit (URT) construction is coming into the stage of rapid development under the guidance of national policies. However, the URT construction projects belong to high-risk projects and construction safety accidents occur frequently. Presently, safety risk management is in continuous development. Unfortunately, due to risk data deficiencies and lack of relationship between participants and safety risk factors, most of the research results cannot be well applied to URT projects. To overcome the limits, this paper has applied the text mining method into safety risk analysis. Through word frequency analysis and cluster analysis, 15 safety risk factors and 3 participants are identified from 156 accident reports. In addition, the accident descriptive model has been established, which is composed of indirect safety risk factors (management defects), direct safety risk factors and participants. In this model, each accident is the standardized description of the corresponding accident information. This is useful for risk data accumulation and analysis. Then the network structure analysis and risk assessment methods are utilized to make clear 63 relationships among participants, management defects and direct safety risk factors. Subsequently, the risk value of each relationship is evaluated. These safety risk information is integrated into the accident descriptive model by using accident points. Finally, ABC analysis which is a popular and effective method used to classify items into specific categories that can be managed and controlled separately is used to analyze the safety risk management's core process(A), important process(B) and general process(C) in the accident descriptive model. The research results show that the constructor should pay attention to construction coordination, safety specifications, safety measures and personnel education, the supervisor should attach importance to timely communication, the monitoring unit should pay attention to advanced forecast and dynamic control. The main research contributions are as follows: (1) A method of obtaining risk data from unstructured content has been provided; (2) The accident descriptive model could be utilized for risk data continuous accumulation; (3) The emphases of URT construction safety risk management are made clear. © 2018 by the authors.

N2  - Most construction project information is stored in unstructured documents, despite its increasing scale and complexity. Owing to ineffective management of construction information, the construction industry is significantly less productive than other industries. Although building information modelling (BIM) is widely employed in the industry, it is difficult to model the project execution phase data owing to its high level of detail. Therefore, this study proposes a framework based on BIM that enables the storing and searching of construction project data through an effective linkage of documents with 3D design objects. The information breakdown structure and spatial breakdown structure, which are the media for integrating construction data with information technology, have been established through the identification and classification of information from unstructured documents from construction sites. The efficiency of the proposed framework in linking documents with 3D objects was validated through a pilot test project and industry survey. The proposed methodology is expected to assist in resolving issues in information management, including enhanced communication, accumulation of know-how, and minimization of disputes, if the utility of the methodology is improved by continuously discovering the best practices at the industrial or organizational level through its extended application. © 2018, Architectural Institute of Japan.

N2  - Construction industry is the largest data industry, but with the lowest degree of datamation. With the development and maturity of BIM information integration technology, this backward situation will be completely changed. Different business data from a construction phase and operation and a maintenance phase will be collected to add value to the data. As the BIM information integration technology matures, different business data from the design phase to the construction phase are integrated. Because BIM integrates massive, repeated, and unordered feature text data, we first use integrated BIM data as a basis to perform data cleansing and text segmentation on text big data, making the integrated data a “clean and orderly” valuable data. Then, with the aid of word cloud visualization and cluster analysis, the associations between data structures are tapped, and the integrated unstructured data is converted into structured data. Finally, the RNN-LSTM network was used to predict the quality problems of steel bars, formworks, concrete, cast-in-place structures, and masonry in the construction project and to pinpoint the occurrence of quality problems in the implementation of the project. Through the example verification, the algorithm proposed in this paper can effectively reduce the incidence of construction project quality problems, and it has a promotion. And it is of great practical significance to improving quality management of construction projects and provides new ideas and methods for future research on the construction project quality problem.

N2  - Building information modeling (BIM) has developed as the definitive technology for managing construction projects. With its rise, the corresponding role of BIM manager has emerged as a necessary adjunct role in coordinating BIM-enabled projects. The ascent of the BIM manager has attracted a significant body of research, investigating the various competencies and responsibilities required of the role. While BIM is here to stay, a recent study, however, asserts that a distinct role oriented around BIM is transitory, which represents a significant departure from accepted assumptions regarding the viability of the BIM manager role. This research sets out to test the likelihood of a long-term market demand for the BIM manager, as a distinct role, based on a robust quantitative analysis of open-source data from a rich empirical dataset of global relevance for North America, Europe, and Australasia. Text mining methods are used. A total of 199 BIM-related jobs were retrieved from 14 of the most relevant job websites, representing the global English speaking job markets. Key knowledge, skills, and abilities that are attributes of BIM jobs were extracted and analyzed. Analysis reveals that there is no significant difference between the roles BIM manager and BIM coordinator. Moreover, the findings highlight that these two BIM roles align with that of project manager. Most importantly, analysis shows that BIM roles supplement the lack of BIM expertise within the role of project manager, and that, as BIM capabilities are increasingly absorbed by project managers, the rationale for an independent BIM expert will fade. The corollary is that BIM roles are a stopgap measure that can be expected to disappear as project managers absorb requisite BIM skills. The practical implication for construction engineering HR departments is that the prevailing policy of retaining dedicated BIM managers into the longer-term future should shift to one in which project managers are retrained to a level at which they possess comprehensive, independent BIM expertise. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.

N2  - In AEC (Architecture, Engineering & Construction) industry, drawing documents are used as a blueprint to facilitate the construction process. It is also represented as a graphical language that communicates ideas and information from one mind to another. In AEC documents, text is present in Machine-printed and hand-written format. Since the algorithms for recognition of machine-printed and hand-written texts are different, it is important to distinguish between these two types of texts before sending the document to respective recognition system. In this paper we proposed a novel approach for the classification machine-printed and hand-written text from AEC Documents. Before Classification Hand-Written and Machine-Printed text from the documents our system used some preprocessing which includes binarization, text graphics separation and word segmentation. The Words are segmented based on certain structural properties of Isothetic Covers (IC) tightly enclosing the words in a document. The grid size properties of IC are selected by some statistical analysis of connected component of the document. Then Word level Gabor Filter based features are extracted with spooling information for classification. A standard classifier based on SVM is used to classify the text. This task is performed at word level of AEC documents and we achieved an overall accuracy of 98.45%. © 2018 IEEE.

N2  - Since construction industrialization can transform construction to an energy-saving, environmental friendly, and economical way of production, the State Council and some other departments of China issued a series of policies to stimulate the development of construction industrialization. However, it is difficult but critical to measure the effectiveness of these policies. This paper proposed a quantitative evaluation approach to the effectiveness of construction industrialization policies, based on five policies passed from 2014 to 2017. These policies were first quantified through text mining. Then, the policy modeling consistency (PMC) index was employed to inform the effectiveness and efficiency of the studied policies. Findings of this paper can be used as references for policy making in construction industrialization. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.

N2  - Checking conformance of construction management practices to practice specifications is typically performed manually by experts in the Engineering and Construction (E&C) sector. Though conformance checking is known to increase performance of a project, this process takes considerable time as several professionals have to go through thousands of pages of documents, complex workflows, and personal interviews. This paper aims to evaluate AI tools including Text mining, process mining, and image data mining for their utility in assisting conformance checking in construction management. Automated conformance checking may not only reduce manual and repetitive work by experts but also reduce human errors. Examples are demonstrated for initial validation. © ISARC 2018 - 35th International Symposium on Automation and Robotics in Construction and International AEC/FM Hackathon: The Future of Building Things.

N2  - Building alteration and redevelopment play a central role in the revitalization of developed cities, where the scarcity of available land limits the construction of new buildings. The adaptive reuse of existing space reflects the underlying socioeconomic dynamics of the city and can be a leading indicator of economic growth and diversification. However, the collective understanding of building alteration patterns is constrained by significant barriers to data accessibility and analysis. We present a data mining and knowledge discovery process for extracting, analyzing, and integrating building permit data for more than 2,500,000 alteration projects from seven major U.S. cities. We utilize natural language processing and topic modeling to discover the thematic structure of construction activities from permit descriptions and merge with other urban data to explore the dynamics of urban change. The knowledge discovery process proceeds in three steps: (1) text mining to identify popular words, popularity change, and their co-appearance likelihood; (2) topic modeling using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA); and (3) integrating the topic modeling output with building information and ancillary data to discover the spatial, temporal, and thematic patterns of urban redevelopment and regeneration. The results demonstrate a generalizable approach that can be used to analyze unstructured text data extracted from permit records across varying database structures, permit typologies, and local contexts. Our machine learning methodology can assist cities to better monitor building alteration activity, analyze spatiotemporal patterns of redevelopment, and more fully understand the economic, social, and environmental implications of changes to the urban built environment. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - The enormous impacts of expressway construction projects (ECPs) on the natural environment worldwide have created the urgency of involving both governments and contractors in the construction process. Governments play a substantial role in motivating contractors to adopt effective technologies and management paradigms to mitigate the environmental impacts of ECPs. A proper perception of this public matter and relevant management approaches is a prerequisite for governments to fulfill such a role. Using China as a case, the purpose of this study is to examine the scope of the environmental impacts that governments perceive and the evolution of the perceptions into management approaches. Response of provincial governments to environmental impact assessment for 132 ECPs was compiled as the materials of the study. Data were retrieved from the materials by using the text mining method. The data analysis reveals that: (1) governments follow the pressure-state-response framework to express their concerns over the environmental impacts; (2) the management approaches that governments consider are embedded in the impacts; (3) governments management approaches are intended to emphasize an ecological perspective. The research findings contribute as a cornerstone for researchers to examine the performance of governments on this public affair and shed some lights on same practices in other countries. © 2019

N2  - Recently, construction-defect litigation has upsurged across the United States. Disputes arise due to a variety of reasons, and result in a range of negative impacts on construction projects, such as increased cost, delay, profit loss, and inconvenience. Although the majority of these disputes settle out of court, a public trail of legal records exists. Previous research has generally been limited to exploring a small subset of such cases based on restricted access to records and data. This ongoing research automates systematic exploration of construction-defect lawsuits in the public domain by using modern computational capabilities of natural language processing and text mining to conduct a comprehensive survey of legal cases over the last 10 years. The approach of this research is to use coded text mining to automatically identify and analyze thousands of publicly available construction-defect cases. To perform such research, the authors developed a program that trolls the national legal database, LexisNexis. Key contributions include the development of a model that can find the frequencies of keywords in the cases and apply a statistical algorithm called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify important topics and themes in order to classify the case data. The research demonstrates new methods for exploring publicly available construction-defect cases. Major challenges are identified and discussed. As exploratory research, the findings are intended to inform and motivate future study, which may lead to identification of broad-based trends in construction-defect litigation. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.

N2  - Social responsibility implementation in construction projects relies on the active involvements by multiple internal and external stakeholders. Stakeholder influences are an important driving force for resolving or alleviating the social and environmental problems in construction activities. To provide a better understanding of the complex stakeholder inter-influence, this research adopted an inductive qualitative method to investigate distinct influence strategies used by project stakeholders in achieving social responsibility goals. The corpus of twenty-five in-depth semi-structured interviews with construction practitioners from the Australian and Hong Kong construction industries was analyzed by a text-mining software, Leximancer. The findings identified the influence strategies of eight stakeholder groups and revealed that all stakeholders used both cooperative and aggressive strategies to influence. In contrast with the statement that power can determine stakeholders' aggressiveness, this research found that the perceived legitimacy and urgency of the concerned issues are the main determinants for stakeholders’ aggressive strategies. The implications for project managers and policy makers are further discussed in the article. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - Purpose: Sustainable construction is widely considered to be the best practice in construction, helping to create a healthy built environment. Social media is identified as a valuable data source for research on sustainable construction, and Twitter is a popular social media platform in relation to the construction. Green Building construction is identified as one of the methods that promotes sustainable construction. The purpose of this study is to characterise “Green Building” as a topic in Twitter. Design/methodology/approach: Social network analysis methods were applied to a large set of Twitter data related to “green building”. Time sequence analysis and network visualisation were used to characterise Twitter activity and to identify influential users. Text analytics and visualisation methods were applied to the same data set to visualise the text content of Twitter posts relating to green building. Findings: Peaks in Twitter activity were associated with physical “green building” events. The network visualisation of the Twitter data revealed a complex structure and a range of types of interactions. The most “influential” users depended on the ranking method used; however, a number of users had high influence in all measures used. The tweet text visualisation showed evidence of a global and interactive audience on Twitter engaged in conversations about green building. Also, it was found that external links, emoji and popular terms related to a particular topic can be used to increase the engagement of Twitter users on that topic. Originality/value: Certain Green Building events were observed to be associated with high levels of Twitter activity. The virtual was found to be closely linked to the physical, and for the promotion of green building construction, their respective impact is potentially the most powerful when used in conjunction. The most influential Twitter accounts did not belong to one class of user, including both individuals and organisations. Twitter offers a platform for a range of stakeholders in the area of green building construction to reach a substantial audience and to be influential in the public sphere. The findings of this research provide a valuable reference for industry practitioners and researchers to deepen their understanding of the application of Twitter to green building construction, and the methods of using Twitter to promote important information related to sustainable construction. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

N2  - Purpose: In the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry, technology developers have difficulties in fully understanding user needs due to the high domain knowledge threshold and the lack of effective and efficient methods to minimise information asymmetry between technology developers and AEC users. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach: A synthetic approach combining domain knowledge and text mining techniques is proposed to help capture user needs, which is demonstrated using building information modelling (BIM) apps as a case. The synthetic approach includes the: collection and cleansing of BIM apps’ attribute data and users’ comments; incorporation of domain knowledge into the collected comments; performance of a sentiment analysis to distinguish positive and negative comments; exploration of the relationships between user sentiments and BIM apps’ attributes to unveil user preferences; and establishment of a topic model to identify problems frequently raised by users. Findings: The results show that those BIM app categories with high user interest but low sentiments or supplies, such as “reality capture”, “interoperability” and “structural simulation and analysis”, should deserve greater efforts and attention from developers. BIM apps with continual updates and of small size are more preferred by users. Problems related to the “support for new Revit”, “import & export” and “external linkage” are most frequently complained by users. Originality/value: The main contributions of this work include: the innovative application of text mining techniques to identify user needs to drive BIM apps development; and the development of a synthetic approach to orchestrating domain knowledge, text mining techniques (i.e. sentiment analysis and topic modelling) and statistical methods in order to help extract user needs for promoting the success of emerging technologies in the AEC industry. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

N2  - This paper comparatively analyzes a method to automatically classify case studies of building information modeling (BIM) in construction projects by BIM use. It generally takes a minimum of thirty minutes to hours of collection and review and an average of four information sources to identify a project that has used BIM in a manner that is of interest. To automate and expedite the analysis tasks, this study deployed natural language processing (NLP) and commonly used unsupervised learning for text classification, namely latent semantic analysis (LSA) and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). The results were validated against one of representative supervised learning methods for text classification—support vector machine (SVM). When LSA and LDA detected phrases in a BIM case study that had higher similarity values to the definition of each BIM use than the threshold values, the system determined that the project had deployed BIM in the detected approach. For the classification of BIM use, the BIM uses specified by Pennsylvania State University were utilized. The approach was validated using 240 BIM case studies (512,892 features). When BIM uses were employed in a project, the project was labeled as “1”; when they were not, the project was labeled as “0.” The performance was analyzed by changing parameters: namely, document segmentation, feature weighting, dimensionality reduction coefficient (k-value), the number of topics, and the number of iterations. LDA yielded the highest F1 score, 80.75% on average. LDA and LSA yielded high recall and low precision in most cases. Conversely, SVM yielded high precision and low recall in most cases and fluctuations in F1 scores. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine various uncertainties underlying the concept of sustainability in construction and built environment (SCBE) and determine if SCBE is a “wicked problem” (WP). Design/methodology/approach: Qualitative text analysis and inductive reasoning are used as research methods in this paper. Text analysis of extant literature is performed to categorise the uncertainties underlying the concept of SCBE. Inductive reasoning, based on these categories of uncertainties and the characteristics of WPs provided in the seminal work of Rittel and Webber (1973), is used to assess SCBE as a probable WP. Findings: Six distinct categories of uncertainties underlying the concept of SCBE are developed: temporal uncertainty, spatial uncertainty, stakeholder uncertainty, societal uncertainty, dimensional uncertainty and assessment uncertainty. The inductive reasoning provides a prima facie evidence that SCBE, underpinned by these uncertainties, is a WP. Originality/value: To the best of author’s knowledge, this is first of its kind analysis that assesses SCBE from a WP perspective by a systematic categorisation of underlying uncertainties. The findings necessitate a new approach for the context-specific conception of sustainability to commensurate with local values. They also provide a sound academic base to challenge the positivist notions generally associated with SCBE, reflected in sustainability assessment and rating systems currently pursued globally as a means of promoting SCBE. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

N2  - The rapid development of the construction industry in China has introduced unprecedented quality-related problems in the country's building industry. In response to this issue, the government has established various complaint channels to report quality problems. Therefore, building quality complaints (BQCs) need to be classified and solved by respective agencies or departments rapidly for avoiding adverse impact on the safety, health, and well-being of people. However, the current process of classifying BQCs is labor intensive, time consuming, and error prone. An automatic complaint classification is required to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of complaint handling, but studies on this issue are limited. Prevailing text classification research in construction has focused on utilizing conventional shallow machine learning. By contrast, this study explores a novel convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach that incorporates a deep-learning method to automatically classify the short texts contained within BQCs. The presented approach enables capturing the semantic features in BQC texts and automatic classification of the BQCs into predefined categories. After the model optimization, tests are conducted to examine the practical application of the text classification approach compared with Bayes-based and support vector machine classifiers. Results indicate that the developed CNN-based approach performs well in the Chinese BQC classification with limited manual intervention and few complicated feature engineering. © 2019

N2  - Knowledge management for construction accident cases can identify dangerous conditions and prevent accidents by controlling risks on-site. However, because accident cases are recorded as unstructured text data, significant time and effort are required to retrieve and analyze the knowledge a user wants. To overcome these limitations, this research proposes a knowledge management system for construction accident cases using natural language processing. For this purpose, two models were developed that can retrieve appropriate cases according to user intentions and automatically analyze tacit knowledge from construction accident cases. In the retrieval model, the query is expanded using a construction accident case thesaurus. Ranking is calculated using Okapi BM25 and weighting according to the thesaurus. In the analysis model, knowledge is automatically extracted using rule-based and conditional random field (CRF) methods. The proposed system can retrieve results that are 97% relevant to the accident cases the user intended and can automatically analyze knowledge with accuracies of 93.75% and 84.13% for the rule-based and CRF models, respectively. The results demonstrate the potential of knowledge discovery from accident reports for more-effective safety management. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.

N2  - Workplace safety is a major concern in many countries. Among various industries, construction sector is identified as the most hazardous work place. Construction accidents not only cause human sufferings but also result in huge financial loss. To prevent reoccurrence of similar accidents in the future and make scientific risk control plans, analysis of accidents is essential. In construction industry, fatality and catastrophe investigation summary reports are available for the past accidents. In this study, text mining and natural language process (NLP) techniques are applied to analyze the construction accident reports. To be more specific, five baseline models, support vector machine (SVM), linear regression (LR), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), decision tree (DT), Naive Bayes (NB) and an ensemble model are proposed to classify the causes of the accidents. Besides, Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) algorithm is utilized to optimize weight of each classifier involved in the ensemble model. Experiment results show that the optimized ensemble model outperforms rest models considered in this study in terms of average weighted F1 score. The result also shows that the proposed approach is more robust to cases of low support. Moreover, an unsupervised chunking approach is proposed to extract common objects which cause the accidents based on grammar rules identified in the reports. As harmful objects are one of the major factors leading to construction accidents, identifying such objects is extremely helpful to mitigate potential risks. Certain limitations of the proposed methods are discussed and suggestions and future improvements are provided. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Text mining is a fast-growing area of research, due to its ability to discover valuable information and getting insights hidden in plain texts. The aim of this paper is to apply text mining in order to analyze construction project contracts and visually analyze project correspondence. Analyzing construction contract helps project parties to figure out their obligations and reduce time and effort needed for contract analysis. Additionally, performing text mining to the contract helps in extracting critical keywords that should be monitored closely in the correspondence. On the other hand, applying text mining for project correspondence helps in gaining an understanding regarding the communication nature and sentiment between project parties. Thus, the paper develops a Dynamic Text Analytical model for Contract and Correspondence “DTA-CC” through utilizing BIM. The DTA-CC model assists project parties to explore texts and get insights regarding the project performance. The specific objectives of this study are to 1-perform a text analytics of the construction project contract, 2- integrate project correspondence within the BIM model and 3- develop a text analytical model based on project's correspondence to monitor the project performance. The DTA-CC model is validated by applying a case study for a construction project located in Cairo, Egypt. The case study found that there is a lot of hidden information in the project's raw data. Moreover, it is crucial to monitor raw data in order to achieve a successful project. This study extends the existing knowledge by proposing a novel methodology to extract meaningful patterns from construction projects data. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Inappropriate management of health and safety (H&amp;S) risk in power infrastructure projects can result in occupational accidents and equipment damage. Accidents at work have detrimental effects on workers, company, and the general public. Despite the availability of H&amp;S incident data, utilizing them to mitigate accident occurrence effectively is challenging due to inherent limitations of existing data logging methods. In this study, we used a text-mining approach for retrieving meaningful terms from data and develop six deep learning (DL) models for H&amp;S risks management in power infrastructure. The DL models include DNNclassify (risk or no risk), DNNreg1 (loss time), DNNreg2 (body injury), DNNreg3 (plant and fleet), DNNreg4 (equipment), and DNNreg5 (environment). An H&amp;S risk database obtained from a leading UK power infrastructure construction company was used in developing the models using the H2O framework of the R language. Performances of DL models were assessed and benchmarked with existing models using test data and appropriate performance metrics. The overall accuracy of the classification model was 0.93. The average R2 value for the five regression models was 0.92, with mean absolute error between 0.91 and 0.94. The presented results, in addition to the developed user-interface module, will help practitioners obtain a better understanding of H&amp;S challenges, minimize project costs (such as third-party insurance and equipment repairs), and offer effective strategies to mitigate H&amp;S risk. © 2019 Society for Risk Analysis

N2  - According to the latest fatal work injury rates reported by the Bureau of Labors Statistics, construction sites remain the most hazardous workplaces. In the construction sector, fatality investigation summary reports are available for past accidents and by investigating such reports, valuable insights can be gained. In this study, text mining algorithms are explored for automatic construction accident causes classification. To be more specific, Word2Vec skip-gram model is utilized to learn word embedding from a domain-specific corpus and a hybrid structured deep neural network is proposed by incorporating the learned word embedding for accident reports classification. Dataset from Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is employed in the experiment to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. Besides, five baseline models: support vector machine (SVM), linear regression (LR), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), decision tree (DT), Naive Bayes (NB) are employed to compare with the proposed approach. Experiment results show that the proposed model achieves the highest average weighted F1 score among all models considered in this study. The result also proves the effectiveness of applying Word2Vec skip-gram algorithm for semantic information augmentation. As a result, robustness of the model is improved when classifying cases of low support values. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Soil excavation is a fundamental step of building and infrastructure development. Despite strong enforcement of construction best practices and regulations, accidents in construction industry are comparatively higher than other industries. Likewise, significant increase in injuries and fatalities are recently reported on geotechnical activities such as excavation pits and trenches. Academic researchers and industry professionals have currently devoted vital attention to acquire construction safety in preconstruction phase of the project. They have developed various algorithms to enhance safety in preconstruction phase such as automated generation of scaffolding and its potential risk analysis, checking BIM model for fall risks, and limited access zone allocation in wall masonry. However, safety in geotechnical works at preconstruction phase is yet unexplored. This paper proposed automatic safety rule compliance approach for excavation works leveraging algorithmic modeling tools and BIM technologies. The focused approach comprises of the following three modules: information extraction and logic design (IELD), information conversion and process integration (ICPI), and automodeling and safety plan generation (ASPG). Specifically, the scope of the paper is limited to major risks such as cave-ins, fall, safety egress, and prohibited zones risks. A set of rules-based algorithms was developed in commercially available software using visual programming language (VPL) that automatically generates geometric conditions in BIM and visualizes the potential risks and safety resources installation along with their quantity take-off and optimized locations. A case study has been presented to validate the proof of concept; automated modeling tool for excavation safety planning generated the required results successfully. It is anticipated that the proposed approach has potential to help the designers through automated modeling and assist decision makers in developing productive and practical safety plans compared to the conventional 2D plans for excavation works at the preconstruction phase. Moreover, it is realized that the same approach can be extended to other rule-dependent subjects in construction. © 2019 Numan Khan et al.

N2  - As construction projects have significantly increased in size and become more complicated, the number of claims and dispute cases between participating parties during the construction work have been continuously increasing. To prevent such claims and disputes, the participants need to be assured of their contractual positions and rights based on contract facts. For this reason, the process of writing and reviewing the contracts for construction work is crucial. Most international construction projects require contract management teams to review all the possible risks in the contracts during the bidding periods. However, it is very difficult to review a vast number of contracts in a short period of time. Therefore, in this study, we proposed an automatic model of contract-risk extraction based on natural language processing (NLP) that can automatically detect the poisonous clauses of the contract in order to support contract management for construction companies (contractors). In validating the performance of the automatic model developed in this study, we found that the precision and recall were both 81.8% compared with manual review. This study is meaningful since a model has been developed that can carry out a preemptive contract-risk review. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.

N2  - The increased availability of interdependent heterogeneous data generated from different sources is fostering the incorporation of semantic knowledge-based graphs and ontologies in information management and search applications. Most of the existing Information Retrieval systems mainly focus on the semantic analysis of the information contained in heterogeneous data. In their results, they provide documents as query answers without considering (i) detailed information regarding relevant granularity levels of the documents, and most importantly (ii) dependencies between the documents or parts of the documents. To overcome these limitations, we propose a graph-based search and ranking algorithm within a generic framework that retrieves the data in the form of a novel augmented data structure for query answers, which we call hybrid molecules. The latter consist of well-defined subgraphs representing relevant contextual information regarding domain-specific information coupled with structural information related to the document. This improves the search results and reduces users' efforts in tracking and interpreting them. Experiments conducted on real world data corpus using projects from the building construction industry validate the effectiveness of our approach. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

N2  - The purpose of this paper is to classify the level of formation of the bid price by using the type of uncertainty inherent in the bid document as a variable. To this end, the research examined the factors of the project related to the bid price presented in the previous study. Next, the pre-bid clarification document, which can be used to check the uncertainty of the bid documents, is used as a surrogate variable. Through these input variables, this research implemented two kinds of models using four algorithms: one predicts the level of bid price with uncertainty of bid document and the other predicts the level of bid price without uncertainty of bid documents. As a result, the model that predicts the level of the bid price reflecting the uncertainty of the bid document shows about 24 percent better performance than the model that predicts the bid price without reflecting the uncertainty of the bid document. © 2019 International Association for Automation and Robotics in Construction I.A.A.R.C.

N2  - Large construction projects generate thousands of documents that require a careful management. The classification of documents is an important step in document management and control. Construction documents are generated in different formats, many of which are unstructured and contain drawings and images, which makes the task of document classification and control even more challenging. In this paper, a dataset of 5000 documents is used as a case study. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) bounding boxes are applied to extract text from the set of documents. In the next step, two classification methods are applied. One based on a predefined set of keywords and another based on deep learning long short-term memory (LSTM) network. The challenges of the proposed approaches are discussed in relation to OCR bounding box locations with different document layout and how to obtain a set of representative key words for each class. Initial results of the study are encouraging and show that OCR technique combined with text classification is a powerful method for construction documents’ control and can reach an accuracy of 92%. © 2019 International Association for Automation and Robotics in Construction I.A.A.R.C.

N2  - Reusing knowledge from past projects is a critical task in construction, given the increasing complexity in such projects: numerous stakeholders, a multidisciplinary domain, and multi-objectives besides the traditional ones such as cost and schedule. Unstructured data, such as progress reports and minutes, is a rich source of knowledge that can be revisited in projects as the contextual nature of documents permits describing the nuances of the interrelations and uniqueness of each project. However, texts are difficult to formalize in a way that the process of retrieval and analysis of relevant knowledge be automated using computers. In this paper, we present an innovative approach that encompasses formalization, retrieval, analysis, and reuse of knowledge from case studies of past construction projects. Assuming that energy is an objective, the cases are represented as a network of common concepts found in every project. The nodes are the concepts, and the links between them are established whenever there is an association between two concepts that affects the energy use in construction. Conversely, the comments of team members of a current project can also be captured and represented using the same standardized set of concepts. Using network analysis, we can retrieve the most relevant cases, which are similar to the current project, study the most important concepts, extract clusters of concepts, and capture the nuances of the cases in a more objective way. A concept map based on the literature and three case studies of past oil and gas projects are developed to undertake this approach. We evaluate the method by simulating the collaborative environment of one of the cases through the participation of ten volunteers in Green 2.0, an online media to discuss construction projects. At the end of the test, we perform a correlation between the networks of the test and the case study. © 2019 International Association for Automation and Robotics in Construction I.A.A.R.C.

N2  - Over the past two decades, hundreds of studies have been published that demonstrate the benefits of 4D building information modeling (BIM) for optimizing construction planning and scheduling. Nonetheless to date, 4D BIM has only been adopted by 35-40% of top engineering news-record (ENR) companies and only used on a small fraction of their projects. The longevity of using 4D BIM also rarely outlasts the pre-construction phase. While the value associated with using 4D BIMs during the construction phase is well documented, the level of effort required to create them has significantly impacted perceptions about their return of investment (ROI) and limited their adoption. To address these inefficiencies, this paper presents a new method - comprised of text mining and machine learning (ML) techniques. Our method parses the description of construction schedule activities, assembles a breakdown structure of work locations/areas, and maps each activity to its corresponding 3D BIM element. Our method also labels each activity to a project phase such that these activities can be animated with different visual cues. Experiment results on 10 real-world construction projects show that the method achieved 89% accuracy in the parsing task. The benefits of the proposed method are discussed in detail. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.

N2  - The development of green buildings is inseparable from public awareness and supports. However, most existing studies focus on the supply side, namely the design and construction of green buildings, with few studies address the public awareness and interests in green buildings. Little is known about whether people in different countries have different levels of interests in green buildings, and how people's such interests change along with time. This study aims to assess and map global public interests in green buildings, thereby contributing to future global efforts to promote sustainable built environment worldwide. Based on Google Trends and the latest data visualization technique, this study analyzes the changing public interests in green buildings across the globe during the past five years. The findings reveal that public interests in green buildings significantly varies in different countries, and it is generally lower than public interests in other environmental topics such as climate change and renewable energy. It is urgent to raise the public awareness and interests in green buildings worldwide, especially in developing countries. This study establishes a basis for formulating future international political and industrial agenda to promote sustainable built environment worldwide. © Advancement of Construction Management and Real Estate, CRIOCM 2017.All right reserved.

N2  - With the rapid increase in complexity in the building industry, project managers are facing more and more complex decision environments and problems. Therefore, it would be beneficial to aid project managers in making sound decisions regarding the intelligent knowledgeable selection of the optimal construction methodology for concrete skeletons while making use of Building Information Modelling (BIM). BIM models� usage fused with modelling, and simulation tools allow efficiently prototyping a building and examining its construction activities before breaking the ground. For this purpose, a semantic object-oriented building model that can support geometric-topological analysis of 3D building elements during design and construction was created. This research focused on the generation and implementation of a framework that extracts building elements, along with their topological relationships and geometrical properties, from an existing fully designed Building Information Model (BIM Model) to be mapped into a directed acyclic Elemental Graph Data Model (EGDM). Data extraction was done with the aid of AutoDesk Revit APIs in a C# platform. This paper demonstrates the significance of the EGDM through the extraction of useful information that can give insight into the construction of the project under study. � 2019 Canadian Society for Civil Engineering.

N2  - Risk factor identification is a critical topic in the construction industry. It is vital for the various construction firms and industry stakeholders to understand the different types of risks that affect their businesses and financial bottom lines. This research created a systematic methodology implementing a new set of text mining methods to identify and classify risk types affecting the publicly traded construction companies, by leveraging their 10-K reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A structured procedure was developed to apply advancements from text mining and natural language processing (NLP) to extract information from textual disclosures. A state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm named FastText was implemented to identify risk patterns and classify the text into appropriate risk types. Key findings showed that operational and financial risks associated with doing business most commonly are disclosed in the risk disclosures filed by the publicly traded construction firms. A steady monotonic increase was found in the average number of total risk disclosures from 2006 to 2018. Over the same period, growth occurred in the proportion of technology risks, reputation/intangible assets risks, financial markets risk, and third-party risks. The primary contributions of this research are (1) the development of a new methodology which serves as a risk thermometer for identification and quantification of risk at an individual company level, subindustry level, and the overall industry level; and (2) minimization of any existing information asymmetry in risk studies by utilization of a source of data that previously has not been used by construction researchers. It is anticipated that the developed methodology and its results can be used by (1) publicly traded construction companies to understand risks affecting themselves and their peers; and (2) surety bond companies and insurance providers to supplement their risk pricing models; and (3) equity investors and capital financial institutions to make more-informed risk-based decisions for their investments in the construction business. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.

N2  - Inappropriate management of health and safety (H&amp;S) risk in power infrastructure projects can result in occupational accidents and equipment damage. Accidents at work have detrimental effects on workers, company, and the general public. Despite the availability of H&amp;S incident data, utilizing them to mitigate accident occurrence effectively is challenging due to inherent limitations of existing data logging methods. In this study, we used a text-mining approach for retrieving meaningful terms from data and develop six deep learning (DL) models for H&amp;S risks management in power infrastructure. The DL models include DNNclassify (risk or no risk), DNNreg1 (loss time), DNNreg2 (body injury), DNNreg3 (plant and fleet), DNNreg4 (equipment), and DNNreg5 (environment). An H&amp;S risk database obtained from a leading UK power infrastructure construction company was used in developing the models using the H2O framework of the R language. Performances of DL models were assessed and benchmarked with existing models using test data and appropriate performance metrics. The overall accuracy of the classification model was 0.93. The average R2 value for the five regression models was 0.92, with mean absolute error between 0.91 and 0.94. The presented results, in addition to the developed user-interface module, will help practitioners obtain a better understanding of H&amp;S challenges, minimize project costs (such as third-party insurance and equipment repairs), and offer effective strategies to mitigate H&amp;S risk. © 2019 Society for Risk Analysis

N2  - To enable full automation, automated code compliance checking systems need to extract regulatory information in building codes and convert it to computable representations. This conversion is a natural language processing (NLP) task that requires highly accurate part-of-speech (POS) tagging results on building codes. Existing POS taggers, however, do not provide such accuracy on building codes. To address this need, the authors propose to improve the performance of POS taggers by error-driven transformational rules that revise machine-tagged POS results. The proposed method utilizes a syntactic and semantic rule-based, NLP approach combined with a structure that is inspired by transfer learning. This method generates a group of transformational rulesets, from simple ones to complex ones, that will convert machine taggers' tagging results to their corresponding human-labeled gold standard. The transformational rules utilize syntactic and semantic information of domain texts. All rules are constrained not to introduce any new errors when fixing existing errors of machine taggers. The last ruleset, which fixes most common remaining errors in textual data after all other rules are applied, is exempted from this constraint. An experimental test on part-of-speech tagged building code (PTBC) data shows this method reduced 82.7% of errors in POS tagging results of building codes, which increased the POS tagging accuracy on building codes from 89.13% to 98.12%. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.

N2  - Chief executive officer (CEO) messages are important in communicating with employees. In terms of sustainability management, it is important to study these messages for their finance and safety content; however, previous studies have focused mostly on the financial aspects. Therefore, our approach is to: (1) focus on safety management, (2) use text mining and network analysis to extract the keywords emphasized by the CEOs, (3) analyze safety management characteristics through factor mapping and network analysis, (4) make recommendations. When the results from the CEO communications of 100 global construction companies were reviewed, keywords including “management”, “value”, “employee”, “system”, “project”, “culture”, “new”, “occupational”, “practice”, and “basis” were deduced. The words “management”, “employee”, and “culture” were the common keywords considered important by CEOs and were highlighted in literature reviews as significant words. Both the deduced keywords and the words deemed important by the CEOs have similar connotations. Motivation, Rules and Regulations, and Resources and Equipment were the factors that exhibited the highest centrality, while Culture and Climate had a structurally high connection. Based on our results, we suggest selecting appropriate words to form consensus with the workers, supplementing the factors related to safety investment with low centrality, and using direct “safety” words, and other relevant words. © 2020 by the authors.

N2  - Purpose: In the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry, technology developers have difficulties in fully understanding user needs due to the high domain knowledge threshold and the lack of effective and efficient methods to minimise information asymmetry between technology developers and AEC users. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach: A synthetic approach combining domain knowledge and text mining techniques is proposed to help capture user needs, which is demonstrated using building information modelling (BIM) apps as a case. The synthetic approach includes the: collection and cleansing of BIM apps’ attribute data and users’ comments; incorporation of domain knowledge into the collected comments; performance of a sentiment analysis to distinguish positive and negative comments; exploration of the relationships between user sentiments and BIM apps’ attributes to unveil user preferences; and establishment of a topic model to identify problems frequently raised by users. Findings: The results show that those BIM app categories with high user interest but low sentiments or supplies, such as “reality capture”, “interoperability” and “structural simulation and analysis”, should deserve greater efforts and attention from developers. BIM apps with continual updates and of small size are more preferred by users. Problems related to the “support for new Revit”, “import & export” and “external linkage” are most frequently complained by users. Originality/value: The main contributions of this work include: the innovative application of text mining techniques to identify user needs to drive BIM apps development; and the development of a synthetic approach to orchestrating domain knowledge, text mining techniques (i.e. sentiment analysis and topic modelling) and statistical methods in order to help extract user needs for promoting the success of emerging technologies in the AEC industry. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

N2  - As an essential way to ensure success of construction projects, on-site inspection involves intensive paperwork, while generating large amounts of textual data. Lack of understanding of information hidden in text-based inspection records always leads to overlooking of important issues and deferred decisions. Therefore, a novel text mining approach based on keyword extraction and topic modeling is introduced to identify key concerns and their dynamics of on-site issues for better decision-making process. Then, the proposed approach was demonstrated in a real world project and tested with 7250 issue records. Results showed that the proposed method could successfully extract key concerns hidden in texts and identify their changes with time, thereby enabling a more efficient on-site inspection and data-centric decisionmaking process. This research contributes: (1) to the body of knowledge a new framework for discovering key concerns and their changes with time in texts, and (2) to the state of practice by providing insights on hot topics and their changes with time to reduce on-site issues and make decisions efficiently. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

N2  - Safety accidents frequently occur in the construction industry, which leads to heavy work in the reports and investigations of safety accidents. Thus, under the background of accelerating the establishment of informationization of construction safety, it is of particular importance to deeply study the informationization of the reports on construction safety accidents and investigations. This paper explored a C-BiLSTM-based approach that combines with deep learning approaches to automatically classify the reports on construction safety accidents and is capable of extracting semantic features from the construction accident reports and automatically classifies them into pre-defined category. The results showed that the proposed C-BiLSTM-based classification performed better in the classification of construction accident reports with less manual intervention and complex engineering. In addition, the reasons and limitations of classification errors were discussed, and suggestions were proposed for improvement. The results of this study can help building safety managers to develop risk management systems. © 2020 IEEE.

N2  - Safety has long been considered an important issue in the construction industry. One means of reducing accidents is to provide for heavy compensation. As per the common law system, precedents, once made, then become part of the legal system. Therefore, construction companies and legal firms have an interest in obtaining details of court cases relevant to the ones they are currently involved with. However, the cost of identifying relevant court cases can be excessive. Computer-based text classification, the process of classifying documents into predefined categories with regard to their content, is proposed in this paper as a way to speed up the procedure whereby court cases are identified as relevant to a particular claim for accident compensation. The data set used for this project consisted of 3000 sentences. The 'training split' was 90% training and 10% for testing. The results show that the precision of the system proposed here for classifying construction accident cases is 95.7% and that the recall is 95.7%. This demonstrates that the fastText-based classification employed can successfully classify papers as relevant to the acceptance or rejection of a compensation case at a fairly high rate of accuracy. This pilot research provides a practical example in order to showcase the possibility of utilising artificial intelligence, without human intervention, for document classification. Such a facility could reduce the time taken to identify relevant past cases, so saving human resources, and improving turn-round times. © 2020 ACM.

N2  - The construction industry is an important pillar of the national economy in many countries, but it is also regarded as one of the most dangerous industries. To lower the rate of construction accidents and facilitate national economic growth, safety control is always the most frequently discussed topic in recent years. In China, government supervision plays an important role in this part by taking regularly inspections on construction sites to ensure control of construction safety. For safety risks such as improper operations or unsafe facilities, the government will take an on-site record and then send formal rectification notices to the contractor to improve the safety condition in time. Based on the methods of text mining and machine learning, this paper analyzes these formal notices issued by the Shanghai Municipal Construction Engineering Safety Quality Supervision Center during 2017-2018. Through text mining, 4,801 rectification notices are first processed by word segmentation, followed with word frequency statistics to obtain safety hazard events with high frequency. Then a library for support vector machines (LIBSVM), integrated software for support vector classification, is used to further classify these potential risks. The result has proved the possibility of the LIBSVM-based construction safety factors classification model for both construction contractors and supervision authorities to better control the overall construction safety situation. The study also reveals that facilities like scaffolds, tower crane, and foundation pit may easily turn into potential hazard sources if they cannot meet corresponding regulations. The findings contribute to a deepened understanding of indicators and facilities affecting construction safety which presents a high frequency of occurrence in construction processes. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.

N2  - Project closeout process is a crucial stage to complete every contractual obligation between the project stakeholders. However, the closeout process usually result in non-adding value activities to satisfy the contract's requirement. In many cases of the project closeout process, key stakeholders work in a negative environment to finish the project's requirements by generating and executing a list of punch list items. Many contractors consider the execution of punch list items including rework or missing work as non-value added activities. This perspective can create a strained relationship between the project's stakeholders including subcontractors and clients. Therefore, this study aims at improving the project closeout phase by analyzing textual data of punch list item recorded by one construction company. The text analysis aims at determining the most recurring punch list items across different projects. Based on the results, a proactive approach to manage punch list items during the project closeout process is proposed to effectively minimize the number of punch list items for a given project. One case study is conducted to test the validity of the proposed approach. It is expected that the proposed approach will help contractors to formally document the project closeout phase as well as predict and proactively address defects in a timely manner. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.

N2  - In achieving full automation of construction cost estimation, the complete processes involved in computing cost estimates must be automated. The typical processes involved in achieving cost estimates are: (1) classification and matching of model elements to their various categories; (2) taking off quantities from design documents or building information models; (3) retrieving unit cost from a cost database; and (4) applying the unit costs and quantities in computing the cost estimate. Although, the level of automation in quantity takeoff has been relatively high, most commercial software programs still require manual inputs from estimators to: (1) match materials of building elements to work items; and/or (2) fulfill essential information requirements that may be missing from design models for accurate cost estimate computations. These missing information are usually obtained from the construction specifications in supplement to the design models. Automating the process of design information extraction from construction specifications can help reduce: (1) the time and cost of the estimation, (2) the manual inputs required in cost estimation computations, and (3) human errors in cost estimates. This paper explores the use of natural language processing techniques to help process construction specifications and the authors propose a new algorithmic method for extracting the needed design information from construction specifications to support wood construction cost estimation. A case study was conducted on a wood construction project to evaluate the authors' proposed method. The results showed that the proposed method successfully searched for and found design details from construction specifications to fulfil essential information requirements for detailed wood construction cost estimation, with a 94.9% precision and a 97.4% recall. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.

N2  - Contract requirement processing is one of the most crucial tasks in the construction projects practicing design-build project delivery method. The contract requirements and technical specifications of design-build projects are typically enormous and associated with many different disciplines and project stages. In many cases, the design-build contractor needs to classify these general contract requirements into different categories to prepare the subcontracts for the specialized works. The success of a design-build project highly relies on the completeness of subcontracts to avoid disputes which may lead to delays and cost overruns. The conventional practices for the preparation of subcontracts require professionals much time and effort to read the complete contract package and extract the requirements related to the specialized works. This paper introduces an effective method to prepare the subcontracts scope by developing an automated framework for information retrieval using natural language processing techniques. The proposed technique classifies the text describing project requirements into three distinct classes associated with different construction project stages namely as design, construction, and operation and maintenance. The requirement classification model was developed using six different supervised machine learning approaches, including naïve Bayes, support vector machine, logistic regression, K-nearest number, decision tree, and feedforward neural network. The experimental results revealed the logistic regression as the highest performing algorithm with an accuracy of 94.12%. This study is expected to help reduce reading time and improve the quality of subcontracts. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.

N2  - Construction industry stakeholders tend to adopt innovative strategies for the smooth operation of their project delivery mechanisms. However, during major disasters such as hurricanes, the construction industry experiences several challenges in responding to an approaching hurricane as well as the aftermath recovery. Online social media platforms are becoming more prevalent for effective information dissemination, and recent studies suggest that social media plays an important role in crisis communication. The primary objective of this study is to reveal social media communication patterns of construction industry during Hurricane Michael (2018). By employing Twitter application programming interface (API), ~275 Million tweets (from Sep. 9 to Nov. 19, 2018) were collected using relevant, keywords such as hurricane, construction, workers, safety, site, subcontractor, hazard, rebuilding, schedule, supply, among others. Several machine learning techniques (topic model and dynamic topics over time) and data mining approaches (most frequent words) have been used to analyze user sentiments and concerns over time and space based on text, geo-locations, and timestamps of such tweets. While the hurricane paths were critical but uncertain to follow over time, this data-driven method revealed crisis communication patterns of construction industry. Specifically, the necessity of planned construction during hurricane, construction at night before landfall, continuous job opportunity in construction industry, and project closure after landfall are among prominent topics. The crisis communication patterns obtained in this study will help construction stakeholders and policymakers to make strategic decisions that are community-centered as well as to facilitate effective response and recovery in major disasters. This type of study can also reveal latent challenges that delay reconstruction of infrastructure and provide opportunities to improve recovery time. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.

N2  - As the number, size, and complexity of building construction projects increase, code compliance checking becomes more challenging because of the time-consuming, costly, and error-prone nature of a manual checking process. A fully automated code compliance checking would be desirable in facilitating a more efficient, cost effective, and human error-proof code checking. Such automation requires automated information extraction from building designs and building codes, and automated information transformation to a format that allows automated reasoning. Natural language processing (NLP) is an important technology to support such automated processing of building codes, because building codes are represented in natural language texts. Part-of-speech (POS) tagging, as an important basis of NLP tasks, must have a high performance to ensure the quality of the automated processing of building codes in such a compliance checking system. However, no systematic testing of existing POS taggers on domain specific building codes data have been performed. To address this gap, the authors analyzed the performance of seven state-of-the-at POS taggers on tagging building codes and compared their results to a manually-labeled gold standard. The authors aim to: (1) find the best performing tagger in terms of accuracy, and (2) identify common sources of errors. In providing the POS tags, the authors used the Penn Treebank tagset, which is a widely used tagset with a proper balance between conciseness and information richness. An average accuracy of 88.80% was found on the testing data. The Standford coreNLP tagger outperformed the other taggers in the experiment. Common sources of errors were identified to be: (1) word ambiguity, (2) rare words, and (3) unique meaning of common English words in the construction context. The found result of machine taggers on building codes calls for performance improvement, such as error-fixing transformational rules and machine taggers that are trained on building codes. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.

N2  - In light of the increasing availability of digitally recorded safety reports in the construction industry, it is important to develop methods to exploit these data to improve our understanding of safety incidents and ability to learn from them. In this study, we compare several approaches to automatically learn injury precursors from raw construction accident reports. More precisely, we experiment with two state-of-the-art deep learning architectures for Natural Language Processing (NLP), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Hierarchical Attention Networks (HAN), and with the established Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency representation (TF-IDF) + Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach. For each model, we provide a method to identify (after training) the textual patterns that are, on average, the most predictive of each safety outcome. We show that among those pieces of text, valid injury precursors can be found. The proposed methods can also be used by the user to visualize and understand the models' predictions. © 2020

N2  - Safety is one key consideration in the monitoring of construction projects by engineers. Accidents in the project can potentially cause issues, such as workers' injury and progress delay, which lead to financial losses. Generally, accident narratives store all summaries and causes of the related events. Since documentations rapidly use large quantities of resources, the implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) begins to seek attention. Nevertheless, in current models, there are still drawbacks, such as weak learning performance and substantial error rate. In this regard, this study develops a hybrid model incorporating Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Symbiotic Organisms Search (SOS), named Symbiotic Gated Recurrent Unit (SGRU). SOS searches the best parameters of GRU to ensure optimal performance. Furthermore, Natural Language Processing is applied to pre-process the text data prior classification process. The experimental result in this study showcases SGRU as the best classification model among other AI models. Therefore, SGRU shares the capability to aid the safety assessments of construction projects. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Staff assignment is the decision-making to determine appropriate workforce with required skills to perform a specific task. Staff assignment is critical to success of construction projects, especially when responding to routine requests such as the change order and building service. However, the effectiveness is low due to manual processing by the management personnel. To improve the productivity of staff assignment, this paper creates a machine learning model that reads service request texts and automatically assigns workforce and priority through the technique of natural language processing (NLP). The dataset used for modeling in this study contains 82,106 building maintenance records for a 3-year period from over 60 buildings on a university campus. The results show a 77% accuracy for predicting workforce and an 88% accuracy for predicting priority, indicating a considerably high performance for multiclass and binary classifications. Different from existing studies, the NLP model highlights the value of stop-words and punctuation in learning service request texts. The NLP model presented in this study provides a solution for staff assignment and offers a piece of the puzzle to the information system automation in the construction industry. This study has an immediate implication for building maintenance; and, in the long term, contributes to human-building interactions in smart buildings by connecting human feedback to building control systems. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Examining past near-miss reports can provide us with information that can be used to learn about how we can mitigate and control hazards that materialise on construction sites. Yet, the process of analysing near-miss reports can be a time-consuming and labour-intensive process. However, automatic text classification using machine learning and ontology-based approaches can be used to mine reports of this nature. Such approaches tend to suffer from the problem of weak generalisation, which can adversely affect the classification performance. To address this limitation and improve classification accuracy, we develop an improved deep learning-based approach to automatically classify near-miss information contained within safety reports using Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding (BERT). Our proposed approach is designed to pre-train deep bi-directional representations by jointly extracting context features in all layers. We validate the effectiveness and feasibility of our approach using a database of near-miss reports derived from actual construction projects that were used to train and test our model. The results demonstrate that our approach can accurately classify ‘near misses’, and outperform prevailing state-of-the-art automatic text classification approaches. Understanding the nature of near-misses can provide site managers with the ability to identify work-areas and instances where the likelihood of an accident may occur. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - Construction project managers (CPMs) are highly in demand in the construction industry, but this has not yet comprehensively been studied from a demand-side perspective. This study investigated the real-world demand for CPMs' competences by mining the big data of job advertisements. Using a large data set of 243,521 job advertisements that covered nearly the whole online job market for CPMs in China over 1 year, we tracked the demands for CPM competences at the industry level. A structural topic model (STM), a text-mining method, was used to analyze the descriptions of the CPM competences requirements to identify the major competences dimensions emphasized in the advertisements. The results suggest that there are eight major competences dimensions that recruiters expect from CPMs. Compared with relatively smaller firms, larger firms place more emphasis on construction site management, project objective monitoring, and organizational management capability. Compared with public firms, private firms prefer coordination and communication, external stakeholder management, and organizational management capability. Cluster analysis of job advertisements further suggested that there are five major types of CPMs, each of which specializes in only a few competences instead of being competent in all aspects. These findings revealed the real-world demands for CPMs and provided theoretical implications for developing a CPM competences framework from a realistic demand-side perspective. The findings also can be utilized to assist construction firms in formulating more-informed recruiting strategies and to help practitioners benchmark their own competences with industry demands. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.

N2  - Construction sites can be particularly vulnerable to natural disasters such as hurricanes. They include incomplete structures that are still under construction, temporary structures and unsecured equipment that could be damaged during disasters, and hazardous materials that require special handling and storage. Therefore, to facilitate more resilient built environments, there is sorely a need to equip construction professionals with knowledge on disaster-resilient construction practices (DRCPs). To address this need, this paper proposes an ontology-based semantic model for representing and reasoning about the knowledge of DRCPs in construction job sites. The model is designed to serve as a foundation for a knowledge-based decision-making system on DRCPs. The model was implemented in a document classification module of the system, and the results of the experiment indicate that the model is applicable in supporting the classification of DRCP knowledge. The proposed model facilitates effective and efficient decision-making towards more resilient construction sites. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Construction is one of the most injury prone industries worldwide. Concerns of health and safety of the employees in construction sites have been a vastly discussed topic for decades. In many countries, companies are required to report safety incidents by using catastrophe investigating report in their workplaces to relevant authorities whereby such data is made publicly available under the open data policy. These open datasets may be well structured or may require further preparation in order to be usable. Some datasets are in the form of reports, which require qualitative, textual analysis to extract insightful information. The purpose of this study is to extract safety hazard factors from an open dataset obtained from the US Occupational Health and Safety Administration, and to further analyse such factors using statistical analysis techniques. For each reported case, text analysis was carried out with the narrative data field describing the circumstances leading to safety incidents to extract safety hazard factors. These hazard factors were categorized into human factors, technical factors, external environmental factors, organizational factors and other factors. The results showed that hazards related to human factors are most common. Descriptive statistics also showed that the most frequent nature of accident was fractures and most frequently occurring accident event was falls to the lower levels. Such information can help to provide insights into the accidents occurred and how relevant authorities may devise strategies to improve construction site safety. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

N2  - Purpose: The Chinese construction industry is experiencing a rapid growth these days. Due to the requirements of energy conservation, emission reduction and construction waste management, the development of prefabricated buildings (PBs) has attracted much attention in the Chinese construction industry. However, the development of PBs are still in their infancy in China, which have been negatively impacted by many obstacles. It is of great significance to clarify and analyze these obstacles for the purpose of promoting the development of PBs in China. Due to the wideness and complex features of obstacles, the existing literature exploring the research topic lacks comprehensiveness. The purpose of this paper is to systematically identify and discuss the obstacles that hinder the development of PBs in China. Design/methodology/approach: This paper adopts the method of news report analysis based on the news reports retrieved from China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and nine major portals in China. The Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) method of content analysis was used to rank the obstacles according to their importance. Findings: A total of 79 obstacles to the development of PBs in China are identified, and the 79 obstacles are divided into 8 dimensions. Among the Top 20 obstacles, the government dimension accounted for the highest number of 5, the market and consumer dimension and development organization dimension were 4, Manufacturing Enterprise of Prefabricated Components (PCs) dimension, construction organization dimension and design organization dimension were 2, logistics enterprise dimension was 1, and industry association dimension was 0. Among them, the biggest obstacle is the high transportation costs. Research limitations/implications: First, data collection may not be very comprehensive. Second, this paper is only based on the obstacles in the development of PBs in China, and the universality of the management conclusions needs to be further strengthened. Practical implications: The research results help the stakeholders in the Chinese PBs industry to better understand the barriers hindering the industry development in a systemic way, which will help propose appropriate strategies to address these barriers. Originality/value: This paper clarifies the obstacles of China's PBs and makes an analysis, which is of great value to the development of China's PBs. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

N2  - The construction industry accounts for 9% of global GDP. Efforts at addressing construction's inherent inefficiencies have over the last decade increasingly involved the deployment of web-based collaborative tools. Consequently, much research has been devoted to assessing these platforms; including interoperability, workflow management and technological limits. What has not been considered to date are the views of web-based tool users themselves as to the functionality, potency and usability of the various platforms available on the market. Currently, there are 5,300,000 documented users of web-based collaborative tools. If web-based collaboration is to be further enhanced, the views of users must be known. This study explores this dimension. Financeonline's top six tools were considered: CoCostruct, PlanGrid, Autodesk BIM 360, Procore, e-builder and Aconex. Around 200 reviews for each tool were collected from 'Business Software Reviews from Software Advice,' resulting in a total dataset of 1,152 complete reviews. Text-mining analysis was applied to this dataset, using RapidMiner Studio 7.5. Thirty key terms with a frequency of over 100 occurrences were retrieved; terms such as software, manage, inform, support, easy use, function, track and friendly. These constitute the subject of the reviews. These terms were then analyzed for sentiment qualifiers; either positive or negative. A total of 804 sentiments were positive, 322 negative and 26 neutral. This study thus highlights that while 70% of user reviews of web-based collaborative tools are positive, there remains much room for improvement. Areas for improvement are also indicated by this study. COPYRIGHT: © 2021 The author(s).

N2  - Existing construction monitoring systems rely on designated personnel to compare a planned procedure in the instructional documents with an execution procedure on the jobsite. It requires major human efforts and is time-consuming, costly, and human error-prone. To reduce manual efforts in collecting information from construction procedural documents, selecting appropriate sensing techniques to collect data on the jobsite, and giving in-time feedback for progress monitoring and compliance checking, the authors: (1) proposed a semantic rule-based information extraction (IE) method to extract construction execution steps from construction procedural documents automatically; (2) developed a construction procedure and data collection (CPDC) ontology to classify construction site information and provide guidance on selecting sensing techniques for collecting jobsite data based on the extracted information; and (3) proposed a construction procedural data integration (CPDI) framework, which could integrate textual data and sensing data to conduct construction execution steps compliance checking automatically. The proposed IE method offers a novel way to retrieve construction activities (e.g., install door and prepare surface) from the construction procedural documents that are an important source of information but were seldom analyzed in previous research. It focuses on extracting construction execution steps, which supports the incorporation of execution sequence information into construction jobsite management. A novel information classification application based on a newly developed CPDC ontology is provided to support IE. The IE results provide a new instrument for selecting sensing techniques based on different construction site data categories. The proposed method is developed to support a targeted unified CPDI framework that integrates the following: natural language processing (NLP) and sensing techniques to automatically extract, analyze, and process both planned procedures from textual data from construction procedural documents and executed procedures from sensing data of construction jobsites. It also can be extended to any domain applications that contain textual information and site activity information that needs to be matched or compared. In this paper, the authors focus on the NLP-based textual information extraction of the construction procedural documents, introduced the detailed steps involved, and proposed a CPDI framework on top of and as an application of the IE method. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the IE method with a set of open-source specifications. Comparing it to a manually developed gold standard, 97.08% precision and 93.23% recall were achieved using the proposed IE method for the extraction of construction execution steps. A qualitative analysis on sensing technique selection based on the IE results was also performed. The proposed IE method can be applied to the automation of construction site management tasks (e.g., construction monitoring) that integrates both textual information and sensing data to support construction decision-makings. It enables the transformation of construction monitoring/control from a human-intensive process to an automated one. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.

N2  - Construction is an industry well known for its very high rate of injuries and accidents around the world. Even though many researchers are engaged in analysing the risks of this industry using various techniques, construction accidents still require much attention in safety science. According to existing literature, it has been found that hazards related to workers, technology, natural factors, surrounding activities and organisational factors are primary causes of accidents. Yet, there has been limited research aimed to ascertain the extent of these hazards based on the actual reported accidents. Therefore, the study presented in this paper was conducted with the purpose of devising an approach to extract sources of hazards from publicly available injury reports by using Text Mining (TM) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. This paper presents a methodology to develop a rule-based extraction tool by providing full details of lexicon building, devising extraction rules and the iterative process of testing and validation. In addition, the developed rule-based classifier was compared with, and found to outperform, the existing statistical classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Kernel SVM, K-nearest neighbours, Naïve Bayesian classifier and Random Forest classifier. The finding using the developed tool identified the worker factor as the highest contributor to construction site accidents followed by technological factor, surrounding activities, organisational factor, and natural factor (1%). The developed tool could be used to quickly extract the sources of hazards by converting largely available unstructured digital accident data to structured attributes allowing better data-driven safety management. © 2021 ASEAN Engineering Journal.

N2  - Construction contracts are known to be the most effective factor to address the challenging subject of risk-sharing between key stakeholders in a project. This study will be conducted for the early recognition of sources of uncertainty in construction contracts that are crucial to avoid when meeting the project objectives. To achieve this goal, a two-stage approach will be used. First, a text analysis method will be developed following previous research to identify key commitments. This rule-based method will rely on a lexicon database that includes promisor-determiner nouns (PDN) and obligation-maker verbs (OMV). Second, to estimate the effects of uncertainties on project objectives, a two-stage risk analysis technique based upon probability and impact estimation will be adapted. The proposed text analysis framework will be validated using MATLAB. The major contribution of knowledge from this study will be to present a text mining risk analysis-based model to assess the patterns of the risk-sharing under general conditions of contract between parties. To quantify the risks of contract obligations, the clauses of general conditions of the New South Wales Government of Australia GC21 (NSW GC21) contract will be analyzed against five project objectives. The results show that the proposed method could be effectively used to identify the main obligations of the other party in the types of contracts to develop the contract strategy for the client and the contractor . © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.

N2  - Contractors responsible for the whole execution of engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) projects are exposed to multiple risks due to various unbalanced contracting methods such as lump‐sum turn‐key and low‐bid selection. Although systematic risk management ap-proaches are required to prevent unexpected damage to the EPC contractors in practice, there were no comprehensive digital toolboxes for identifying and managing risk provisions for ITB and contract documents. This study describes two core modules, Critical Risk Check (CRC) and Term Frequency Analysis (TFA), developed as a digital EPC contract risk analysis tool for contractors, using artificial intelligence and text‐mining techniques. The CRC module automatically extracts risk‐in-volved clauses in the EPC ITB and contracts by the phrase‐matcher technique. A machine learning model was built in the TFA module for contractual risk extraction by using the named‐entity recognition (NER) method. The risk‐involved clauses collected for model development were converted into a database in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format, and the final results were saved in pickle format through the digital modules. In addition, optimization and reliability validation of these modules were performed through Proof of Concept (PoC) as a case study, and the modules were further developed to a cloud‐service platform for application. The pilot test results showed that risk clause extraction accuracy rates with the CRC module and the TFA module were about 92% and 88%, respectively, whereas the risk clause extraction accuracy rates manually by the engi-neers were about 70% and 86%, respectively. The time required for ITB analysis was significantly shorter with the digital modules than by the engineers. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

N2  - Management of constraints (e.g. materials and labour) is a major challenge in construction projects. Advanced working packaging (AWP) is an effective constraint-management method. However, one prerequisite for AWP, i.e. constraint modelling, is generally performed manually. Information extraction methods in the industry cannot meet the demands for AWP, because they focus on entity extraction but ignore extraction of semantically rich relations. To address this problem, this study proposes a hybrid deep learning model. A bidirectional long short-term memory and conditional random field (Bi-LSTM-CRF) model and knowledge representation learning (KRL) model are developed to extract entities and relations among entities from text documents, respectively. To better apply the KRL model, the study maps domain classes of entities and then stacks class information in the model structure, while employing synonym mapping to handle entities unseen during training. The overall accuracies for extracting entities and relations can reach 0.936 and 0.884, respectively, and adding class information increases relation extraction performance metrics by 6.63%. In a scenario implementation, it is shown that the model can automate constraint modelling for ongoing projects. Therefore, the model is useful for AWP and can reduce delays and reworks by saving a significant amount of time for constraint monitoring and removal. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Construction site fall accidents are a high-frequency accident type in the construction industry and have received extensive attention from accident causal factor analysis and risk management research, but evaluating the relationship between accident causal factors and unstructured texts remains an area in urgent need of further study. In this paper, an analysis method based on text mining was chosen to analyze and process the collected data of 557 investigation reports of construction site fall accidents in China from 2013 to 2019. First, the accident reports were preprocessed to identify six types and 28 causal factors of fall accidents; subsequently, the 28 causal factors were classified into critical causal factors, subcritical causal factors and general causal factors according to their document frequency. Then, the Apriori algorithm was used to analyze the correlation of construction site fall accidents. Finally, strong association rules were obtained between the accident causal factors and between the causal factors and the types of construction site fall accidents. The results showed that 1) insufficient safety technology training and untimely elimination of hidden danger in safe production were the most frequent accident causal factors in fall accident reports. 2) There were different degrees of strong and weak correlations among the causal factors of construction site fall accidents, among which the higher the importance was, the stronger the correlation. 3) There were strong potential laws between the causal factors and the types of fall accidents, and the combination of some causal factors was most likely to lead to the occurrence of the corresponding accident types. This study scientifically and logically elucidated the inherent risk factors for fall accidents, which provides a theoretical basis for preventing fall accidents in construction projects. © Copyright © 2021 Luo, Liu and Qiu.

N2  - Construction engineering design is highly dependent on previous experience so experienced engineers normally produce the design. This practice allows the leakage of knowledge when experienced engineers leave and is costly in terms of the time required for design work. This study proposes a knowledge management-based engineering design system (KMEDS) that supports engineering design of highways and roads. A text mining technique using a vector space model (VSM) is used to retrieve documents. Nine historical design cases containing 1,683 engineering documents are collected as the knowledge base. A real-world express highway design project is used to test the feasibility of the proposed method. A questionnaire survey is then conducted to evaluate the proposed KMEDS. The approval rate is 88% in terms of system correctness and 86% in terms of time savings. © 2021. The Author(s). All Rights Reserved.

N2  - Workplace accidents in construction commonly cause fatal injury and fatality, resulting in economic loss and negative social impact. Analysing accident description reports helps identify typical construction safety risk factors, which then becomes part of the domain knowledge to guide safety management in the future. Currently, such practice relies on domain experts' judgment, which is subjective and time-consuming. This paper developed an improved approach to identify safety risk factors from a volume of construction accident reports using text mining (TM) technology. A TM framework was devised, and a workflow for building a tailored domain lexicon was established. An information entropy weighted term frequency (TF-H) was proposed for term-importance evaluation, and an accumulative TF-H was proposed for threshold division. A case study of metro construction projects in China was conducted. A list of 37 safety risk factors was extracted from 221 metro construction accident reports. The result shows that the proposed TF-H approach performs well to extract important factors from accident reports, solving the impact of different report lengths. Additionally, the obtained risk factors depict critical causes contributing most to metro construction accidents in China. Decision-makers and safety experts can use these factors and their importance degree while identifying safety factors for the project to be constructed. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - As a data tool applicable to the full life-cycle of construction engineering and management, Building Information Modeling (BIM) has great potential for significantly increasing project productivity and performance. Awareness of BIM application hotspots and forecasting its trends can drive innovations in construction field. Using patents as data resources, this study develops an effective framework integrating the citation network analysis and the topic clustering technology to identify BIM application information and forecast its trends. This framework comprises three-step analysis: (1) quantitative characteristic analysis of patent outputs; (2) Social Network Analysis (SNA)-based co-occurrence network analysis; and (3) identification of BIM topics using a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Finally, the case demonstrates the effectiveness of this framework contributing to promote technological development and innovation of BIM. The contributions of this study are threefold: (1) an innovative text mining-based framework for BIM patent analysis in construction is developed; (2) patents that have focused on identifying the application hotspots and development trend of BIM in accordance with our developed framework are reviewed; and (3) a signpost for technological development and innovation of BIM is provided. © 2021 The Author(s).

N2  - Construction projects face various constraints (e.g., materials and equipment). Constraint management approaches such as advanced working packaging (AWP) can remove constraints and ensure smooth work. However, due to inefficient information extraction, the prerequisite of AWP, i.e., identifying and modelling constraints, are performed manually. Efforts that integrate constraint information into project knowledge bases are also limited. This paper proposes a hybrid approach to automatically extract and integrate constraint information from texts. The approach combines a deep learning model with pre-defined rules. The model extracts constraint entities whereas rules created based on domain knowledge are used to establish relations between these entities. Extracted information is encoded into the original ontologies. The approach can extract both entities and relations with over 90% accuracy. The original ontologies can be successfully enriched and support semantic queries. The approach improves AWP by partially automating constraint identification and modelling as well as ontology development for information integration. © 2021

N2  - Construction projects delivered using the Design-Build (DB) method include a single contract which defines requirements associated with various disciplines involved in the project. Consequently, DB contractors often need to develop several subcontracts including only a subset of requirements from the main contract. The current manual practices for subcontract drafting are error-prone and time-consuming. The study developed a novel classification model using machine learning for classifying DB requirements into three predefined categories including design, construction, and operation and maintenance. The paper compared various training approaches to perform DB requirement classification including traditional algorithms (i.e., Naïve Bayes, support vector machine, logistic regression, decision tree, and k-nearest neighbor), and two state-of-the-art deep neural networks architectures (i.e., convolutional neural network and recurrent neural network). In addition, it examined the effect of different feature types, feature selection, feature weighting, and ensemble methods on the model training performance. The classification models were trained on a large dataset of over 3000 contractual clauses, and the best model achieved an impressive precision of 93.20%, a recall of 93.08%, and an F-score of 92.98%.

N2  - Construction projects are prone to disputes that are predominately caused by the failure of parties to keep their contractual obligations, and, if not resolved, may spiral into complex legal issues that may take years to resolve. Contracts, which are expected to allocate the obligations to parties in a balanced manner, are often claimed to be focused on controlling one party by putting maximum obligations on it. The present study aims to quantitatively understand and compare the extent of control focus in various standard forms of contracts. To this end, text mining and natural language processing (NLP) techniques are used to analyze 12 standard Indian and international forms, and instances of client and contractor obligation distribution are compared. The results demonstrate that generally the international standard forms are less control focused then their Indian counterparts. Further, a majority of the standard forms have evolved with more control focus over time. The findings of this study are expected to open up the concept of measuring the quality of drafting of standard forms with an objective to make contracts less prone to costly arbitrations and litigations. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.

N2  - Sand theft or illegal mining in river dredging areas has been a problem in recent decades. For this reason, increasing the use of artificial intelligence in dredging areas, building automated monitoring systems, and reducing human involvement can effectively deter crime and lighten the workload of security guards. In this investigation, a smart dredging construction site system was developed using automated techniques that were arranged to be suitable to various areas. The aim in the initial period of the smart dredging construction was to automate the audit work at the control point, which manages trucks in river dredging areas. Images of dump trucks entering the control point were captured using monitoring equipment in the construction area. The obtained images and the deep learning technique, YOLOv3, were used to detect the positions of the vehicle license plates. Framed images of the vehicle license plates were captured and were used as input in an image classification model, C-CNN-L3, to identify the number of characters on the license plate. Based on the classification results, the images of the vehicle license plates were transmitted to a text recognition model, R-CNN-L3, that corresponded to the characters of the license plate. Finally, the models of each stage were integrated into a real-time truck license plate recognition (TLPR) system; the single character recognition rate was 97.59%, the overall recognition rate was 93.73%, and the speed was 0.3271 s/image. The TLPR system reduces the labor force and time spent to identify the license plates, effectively reducing the probability of crime and increasing the transparency, automation, and efficiency of the frontline personnel’s work. The TLPR is the first step toward an automated operation to manage trucks at the control point. The subsequent and ongoing development of system functions can advance dredging operations toward the goal of being a smart construction site. By intending to facilitate an intelligent and highly efficient management system of dredging-related departments by providing a vehicle LPR system, this paper forms a contribution to the current body of knowledge in the sense that it presents an objective approach for the TLPR system. © 2021 by the authors.

N2  - According to the Ministry of Employment and Labor's industrial accident statistics over the past decade, the number of accident deaths in the construction filed is the highest among all industries. Although participants in the construction process and institutions like Ministry of Employment and Labor and Korea Occupational Safety and Health Agency for safety inspection, have been conducting intensive management over the past years to reduce deaths in the construction industry, there has been no significant reduction in occupational accident. The construction industry and academia have been conducting various research and development to improve construction site safety. However, because there is a limit to increasing safety at construction sites only through individual research, efforts should be made to understand between the studies. This study explores domestic research trends in studies related to construction accident using text mining techniques. For this, a corpus was compiled, comprising published papers related to ‘construction accident’ from KERIS and KISTI during a period from 2000 to 2020. From this corpus, keywords were extracted using KoNLPy in Python and then a Network was built for Semantic Network Analysis by using the keywords. As a result of this study, the keywords 'Worker', 'Accident' and 'Site' found to be the main Keywords as hubs. In addition, the analysis of communities within the network identified five research directions; direct accident factors such as types and original cause materials, specific site safety management factors, working environment factors due to social structural changes, human error, and safety climate in construction site. The results show the trend of research on topics related to construction accident in Korea, which can contribute to identifying domestic research directions and determining subsequent research topics in the field. © 2021, Architectural Institute of Korea.

N2  - Automated building code compliance checking systems were under development for many years. However, the excessive amount of human inputs needed to convert building codes from natural language to computer understandable formats severely limited their range of applicable code requirements. To address that, automated code compliance checking systems need to enable an automated regulatory rule conversion. Accurate Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging of building code texts is crucial to this conversion. Previous experiments showed that the state-of-the-art generic POS taggers do not perform well on building codes. In view of that, the authors are proposing a new POS tagger tailored to building codes. It utilizes deep learning neural network model and error-driven transformational rules. The neural network model contains a pre-trained model and one or more trainable neural layers. The pre-trained model was fine-tuned on Part-of-Speech Tagged Building Codes (PTBC), a POS tagged building codes dataset. The fine-tuning of pre-trained model allows the proposed POS tagger to reach high precision with a small amount of available training data. Error-driven transformational rules were used to boost performance further by fixing errors made by the neural network model in the tagged building code. Through experimental testing, the authors found a well-performing POS tagger for building codes that had one bi-directional LSTM trainable layer, utilized BERT_Cased_Base pre-trained model and was trained 50 epochs. This model reached a 91.89% precision without error-driven transformational rules and a 95.11% precision with error-driven transformational rules, which outperformed the 89.82% precision achieved by the state-of-the-art POS taggers. © 2020

N2  - Hazard warnings derived from hazard associations help in guiding safety inspectors, while detailed descriptions may limit risk perceptions. However, outlining characteristics of hazards may help inspectors to conduct subjective searches for hazards with fewer preset conditions. This study aimed to facilitate safety inspections by determining critical characters of hazards using a character-based network of networks (NoN) with actual construction site data. First, characters were extracted using text analysis and categorized by hierarchical clustering. Then, a character-based NoN was established using network analysis. Critical characters and hazards were generated by considering association strengths and node measures. Finally, the practicability and reliability of associated characters were validated through a case study. Results indicated that (1) “facility/equipment/device,” “setting,” “site/construction site,” and “power distribution/distribution box” were critical characters by evaluation of outdegree, betweenness, closeness, and eigenvector centrality; (2) the hazard warning route from “railing” to “facility/equipment/device” was obtained through associations within and between different layers of the NoN. The case study indicates that the proposed approach based on character associations not only simplifies hazard association routes but also discovers hazards omitted from the hazard network. In practice, the proposed method may assist safety inspectors to focus on critical characters and thereby improve the efficiency of risk identification. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - When bidding on construction projects, contractors need to understand the specifications properly to manage project risks. However, specifications are mainly analyzed based on human cognitive abilities, which can take considerable time and can lead to errors due to misunderstanding. While efforts have been made to automate this process, that the existing academic efforts to automate the process have limitations. To develop an automated specification reviewing model applicable to various kinds of specifications, the authors propose information extraction frameworks consisting of five categories. In addition, a named entity recognition (NER) model was developed based on bidirectional long short-term memory architecture to extract information from text data automatically. The data set for model development comprised 56 construction specifications, which included a total of 4,659 sentences labeled according to five categories of information. Word2Vec was utilized to aconvert labeled text data to the form of numeric vectors to be input into the NER model. The NER model successfully assigned every word in the testing data to an appropriate category with a satisfactory performance of 0.919 precision and 0.914 recall. These results contribute to the automation of the construction specification review process. Although this research focused on road construction projects, the proposed information extraction framework can be applied to other types of construction projects. © 2020 This work is made available under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

N2  - This article proposes an analysis of research dedicated to permafrost. Its originality is twofold: it covers a corpus (n = 16,249) that has never been reviewed before and also makes use of a methodology based on successive textual analysis processes. With the text-mining of additional corpuses, we produce lists of qualified terms to fine-tune the indexing of the main corpus and isolate relevant terminology dedicated to infrastructure and soil properties. With these enrichments combined with other terminological extractions (such as place names recognition), we reveal the internal structure of permafrost research with the help of visual mapping and easily prove that permafrost research is multidisciplinary and multi-topical The semantic map and the diachronic analysis of terms clusters show that the interest had turned since the 1980s towards the role of climate change but also on China's needs for its highway and railway construction sites. The very strong and growing impact of Chinese research, focused on the Tibetan area, is one of the highlights of our data. Furthermore, we propose a focus on infrastructure vulnerability and use soil properties as a proxy to measure the existing interactions between two distinct research communities. The results suggest that research has mainly focused so far on the feasibility of building on frozen ground and exploiting soils, but remains at an early stage of addressing the impact of global warming on infrastructure degradation and its resilience. This study offers insights to permafrost experts, but also provide a methodology that could be reused for other investigations. © 2020, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

N2  - Construction disputes are one of the main challenges to successful construction projects. Most construction parties experience claims—and even worse, disputes—which are costly and time-consuming to resolve. Lessons learned from past failure cases can help reduce potential future risk factors that likely lead to disputes. In particular, case law, which has been accumulated from the past, is valuable information, providing useful insights to prepare for future disputes. However, few efforts have been made to discover legal knowledge using a large scale of case laws in the construction field. The aim of this paper is to enhance understanding of the multifaceted legal issues surrounding construction adjudication using large amounts of accumulated construction legal cases. This goal is achieved by exploring dispute-related contract terms and conditions that affect judicial decisions based on their verdicts. This study builds on text mining methods to examine what type of contract conditions are frequently referenced in the final decision of each dispute. Various text mining techniques are leveraged for knowledge discovery (i.e., analyzing frequent terms, discovering pairwise correlations, and identifying potential topics) in text-heavy data. The findings show that (1) similar patterns of disputes have occurred repeatedly in construction-related legal cases and (2) the discovered dispute topics indicate that mutually agreed upon contract terms and conditions are import in dispute resolution. © 2021 by the authors.

N2  - Semantic search engines, which integrate the output of text mining (TM) methods, can significantly increase the ease and efficiency of finding relevant documents and locating important information within them. We present a novel search engine for the construction industry, HSEarch (http://www.nactem.ac.uk/hse/), which uses TM methods to provide semantically-enhanced, faceted search over a repository of workplace accident reports. Compared to previous TM-driven search engines for the construction industry, HSEarch provides a more interactive means for users to explore the contents of the repository, to review documents more systematically and to locate relevant knowledge within them.

Based on the random forest algorithm, our work proposes a sameness analysis method of engineering problem description text, and realizes the task of automatic classification of engineering defects. This work first defines the concept of sameness recognition in power construction project, and performs Chinese word segmentation on the problem description text in the engineering information data set after the standardized processing. Then, this work constructs a feature vector space. By implementing random forest algorithm, this work conducts sameness analysis and defect classification on the construction problem text, and proves the effect of the method proposed in this work through case analysis. © 2021 IEEE

N2  - In the construction industry, contractors require precise knowledge of design restrictions originating from regulatory documents and contract specifications. For the automatic compliance checking of the building design regarding these rules, they have to be converted from the representation in natural language to a machine-readable format. This task, if carried out by human experts, is quite laborious and error-prone, and thus its automation is anticipated. A building block of this information extraction process is to find the key terms which carry the semantic information in each design rule. Named entity recognition, a sub-task of information extraction in the field of natural language processing, aims towards finding these entities in unstructured text and assigning them a label according to predefined classes. This paper presents a method based on a supervised deep learning transformer model, which is used to extract relevant terms from a corpus of German regulatory documents. It requires few training data, no user interaction and achieves weighted performance scores of over 95% precision and 95% recall, given that 12 unbalanced classes are specified. Additionally, it is investigated how different tagging schemes and model variations affect the classifier’s performance. For future extensions, the class labels are chosen such that they can be linked to concepts already defined by Industry Foundation Classes. As part of this study, a training data set is created consisting of 2500 sentences from construction law documents, annotated with named entity tags. © 2021 Proceedings of the International Symposium on Automation and Robotics in Construction.

N2  - The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) was a challenging milestone construction project that boosted the Hong Kong construction industry participants to new heights of recognition. While industry-boosting long-term benefits arose from knowledge gained in managing specialist prefabrication processes and complex supply chains (SCs), these advances also necessarily imposed challenges, rendering the project highly vulnerable to disruptions. Therefore, higher resilience was essential to withstand higher Supply Chain Vulnerabilities (SCV) through enhanced capabilities, for which identifying dynamic SCV becomes critical. To address this, the study employed the Topic Over Time modelling approach to detect critical SCV using 1,748 unstructured official documents on the HZMB from 2003 to 2018 (project design to handover). The popularity trend analysis that was thereby conducted, enabled identifying the six most critical vulnerabilities and categorizing them among each project phase. Finally, an ex-post vulnerability evaluation map was developed by considering the vulnerabilities' popularity trend and their relevance towards the project and SC phases. Using these findings, industry practitioners could improve their ex-ante decision-making, targeting value-enhanced-resilient SCs in future prefabricated infrastructure development projects. Further, the text-mining research approach unveils an effective mechanism for researchers to extract dynamic empirical clues from a large unstructured set of documents in construction SCs. © 2021 Proceedings of the 37th Annual ARCOM Conference, ARCOM 2021.

N2  - In recent years, building information modeling and artificial intelligence of things (BIM-AIOTs) in the construction industry have gained much attention. Construction engineers and researchers learn about BIM-AIOT and increase their professional knowledge through internet searches. However, the large amount of information on the internet makes it difficult to find specific information. Although some previous work of BIM-related searches exists, most still search with a combination of keywords or longer terms. This paper utilizes a machine learning model with natural language processing (NLP) technique of bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) integrated with a mobile chatbot as a question and answer (QnA) system. The dataset used for modeling contained 3334 text paragraphs that shortened to 10,002 questions. The result shows an F1 score of around 65% accuracy, which is acceptable for model prediction. Then, the system verifies to synchronize to the server and user interface. The system works well for information search and offers a supporting automation information system in the construction industry. This study achieved conversational machine understanding and a user-friendly BIM-AIOT integration information searches platform. The proposed system has a reliable research-based information source. It is verified as an effective and efficient way to produce fast decision-making. The system is deemed a future application for research-based problem-solving solutions in Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC). © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Construction sites are the most hazardous workplace in the world. Occupational safety is one of the high-priority safety concerns across the globe. Among all the sectors, the construction sector contributes towards more hazardous fatalities. Along with a huge loss in manpower, it also causes drastic financial loss. In this study, text mining techniques along with deep neural networks are used for text classification. In detail, GloVe word embeddings with 300 dimensions are employed. We propose the context connotative network (CCNet) for accident causes classification. The dataset taken into account in this research work is referred from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) website. Besides, 5 baseline models namely Logistic Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), and Decision Tree (DT) are trained for comparison with the CCNet model. The results of this research work show that the proposed CCNet model outperforms all the other standard models employed, in respect of the average weighted F1 score metric. Experiment results prove that using GloVe embeddings helped to capture semantic relationships between words and extracting noun and verb phrases helped in boosting the performance of the proposed model. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - Retrieving queried information from building information models (BIM) requires experience in structured query languages and manipulation of BIM software. Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based spoken dialogue systems provide more opportunities for information retrieval from building information models via natural language queries. This research developed a transfer learning-based text classification (TC) method to classify different queries into pre-defined categories for an intelligent building information spoken dialogue system (iBISDS), a virtual assistant that provides information retrieval support for construction project team members. The architecture of the TC neural network (NN) was built based on the pre-trained Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach (RoBERTa). After the training process, the re-trained and fine-tuned RoBERTa NN achieved a precision of 99.76%, a recall of 99.76%, and an F1 score of 99.76% on the testing dataset. The experimental results indicated that the developed NN algorithm for TC can relatively accurately classify different building information-related queries into pre-defined TC categories. © 2022

N2  - Construction projects involve multiple company departments and disciplines. The departments follow certain rules in implementing a project, also referred to as requirements in a construction contract. Current administration practices do not show which discipline or department is related to any requirement in the contracts. Thus, all departments need to review contract requirements but typically only from their perspective and with minimal communication with one another. In addition to the tendency of this manual process to error, time and money are lost in evaluating irrelevant departmental requirements. This study concentrates on one aspect of contract interpretation, coordination of the contract requirement review. Automating a classification of the contract requirements by relevant departments can increase the efficiency of contract reviews. This study proposes a robust approach to automating contract sentence classification by relevance to the company department. The approach comprises both natural language processing (NLP) and supervised machine learning techniques to train an algorithm. Training data are selected from an internationally and widely used standard form of construction contract. Precision metric results as high as 0.952 and recall metric results as high as 0.786 are acquired by support vector classifiers (SVCs). These are considered sufficient within the context of multilabel classification of construction contract sentences for construction professionals to operate without further training. The developed methodology reduces time spent on contract review, reliably and accurately predicts classification of contract sentences for departmental relevance, and also removes the dependence on expert participation in coordination efforts contract review. © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.

N2  - Project management standards, like PMBOK, have had a considerable role in developing this field of knowledge and promoting it as a professional expertise in project-oriented industries, such as the construction industry. The latest version of PMBOK, seventh edition—2021, has been released with substantial changes, and the conventional process-based system has been converted to a performance-based approach. This study aimed to investigate the recent edition of PMBOK, to explore its application and adaptation regarding the specific characteristics of the construction industry. For this purpose, utilizing a hybrid methodology of text mining and survey method, at first, the content of the text was analyzed by software in combination with experts’ opinions. In a parallel survey, the distinctive attributes of the construction industry were investigated, and in the next step, the way that this sector can benefit from the emerging framework was examined. The results show the construction industry has special peculiarities in the form of four different project types with specific phases in typical lifecycle and reveal the potential applicability of performance domains in the construction projects and the compatibility of project management principles. This study is one of the first attempts to review the novel presented standard of PMBOK seventh edition and contributes to the present knowledge by analyzing the construction industry in relation to this issue. © 2022 by the authors.

N2  - Introduction: Ensuring occupational health and safety is an enormous concern for organizations, as accidents not only harm workers but also result in financial losses. Analysis of accident data has the potential to reveal insights that may improve capabilities to mitigate future accidents. However, because accident data are often transcribed textually, analyzing these narratives proves difficult. This study contributes to a recent stream of literature utilizing machine learning to automatically label accident narratives, converting them into more easily analyzable fields. Method: First, a large dataset of accident narratives in which workers were injured is collected from the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Word embeddings-based text mining is implemented; compared to past works, this methodology offers excellent performance. Second, to improve the richness of analyses, each record is assessed across five dimensions. The machine learning models provide classifications of body part(s) injured, the source of the injury, the type of event causing the injury, whether a hospitalization occurred, and whether an amputation occurred. Finally, demonstrating generalizability, the trained models are deployed to analyze two additional datasets of accident narratives in the construction industry and the mining and metals industry (transfer learning). Practical Applications: These contributions improve organizations’ capacities to rapidly analyze textual accident narratives. © 2021 The Author

N2  - Safety hazard management of large construction projects is essential to ensuring construction safety. This study used text mining of safety hazard management information for more than three years collected from a large construction project's information system with automatic word segmentation, part-of-speech tagging and term frequency (TF)-inverse document frequency (IDF) analyses to extract and classify hazard features. This methodology analyzes the safety hazard features to identify the safety hazard conditions on site in real time. The hazard features are further analyzed by different hazard types and different roles of the organizations. This study also investigates the impact of the hazard features on the management efficiency. This paper provides an effective on site safety hazard management method which can help managers focus on the key needs and improve construction efficiency. © 2022, Tsinghua University Press.

Data sharing is crucial for multiple stakeholders to achieve smart construction management. However, a unified framework is absent for data sharing between stakeholders. This study aims to develop a unified framework for data sharing in smart construction at the project level. A two-pronged design method is adopted to develop a unified framework for data sharing in smart construction using text analysis and semi-structured interviews. Then, a case study is incorporated for the application of the smart construction management framework. The unified framework for data sharing is developed as a five-layer architecture, consisting of the primary layers of perception, transmission, database, application, and presentation. The function modules of the unified framework include on-site monitoring, personnel, safety, quality, material, digital file, environment, and supervision, supported by the implementation of BIM, cloud computing, and IoT techniques. As illustrated in the case study, the construction period can be saved by 50 days and the cost can be saved by 4.2% after implementing the proposed framework in the project. This study provides a benchmark for related studies on data management and collaborative innovation from various industries and stakeholders. Also, a useful framework has been developed by identifying the key elements, defining the primary functions, and developing the essential layers based on structural consistency. © 2022, Korean Society of Civil Engineers.

N2  - Purpose: Contractors must check the provisions that may cause disputes in the specifications to manage project risks when bidding for a construction project. However, since the specification is mainly written regarding many national standards, determining which standard each section of the specification is derived from and whether the content is appropriate for the local site is a labor-intensive task. To develop an automatic reference section identification model that helps complete the specification review process in short bidding steps, the authors proposed a framework that integrates rules and machine learning algorithms. Design/methodology/approach: The study begins by collecting 7,795 sections from construction specifications and the national standards from different countries. Then, the collected sections were retrieved for similar section pairs with syntactic rules generated by the construction domain knowledge. Finally, to improve the reliability and expandability of the section paring, the authors built a deep structured semantic model that increases the cosine similarity between documents dealing with the same topic by learning human-labeled similarity information. Findings: The integrated model developed in this study showed 0.812, 0.898, and 0.923 levels of performance in NDCG@1, NDCG@5, and NDCG@10, respectively, confirming that the model can adequately select document candidates that require comparative analysis of clauses for practitioners. Originality/value: The results contribute to more efficient and objective identification of potential disputes within the specifications by automatically providing practitioners with the reference section most relevant to the analysis target section. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

N2  - Accidents of various types in the construction of hydropower engineering projects occur frequently, which leads to significant numbers of casualties and economic losses. Identifying and eliminating near misses are a significant means of preventing accidents. Mining near-miss data can provide valuable information on how to mitigate and control hazards. However, most of the data generated in the construction of hydropower engineering projects are semi-structured text data without unified standard expression, so data association analysis is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Thus, an artificial intelligence (AI) automatic classification method based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) is adopted to obtain structured data on near-miss locations and near-miss types from safety records. The apriori algorithm is used to further mine the associations between "locations"and "types"by scanning structured data. The association results are visualized using a network diagram. A Sankey diagram is used to reveal the information flow of near-miss specific objects using the "location → type"strong association rule. The proposed method combines text classification, association rules, and the Sankey diagrams and provides a novel approach for mining semi-structured text. Moreover, the method is proven to be useful and efficient for exploring near-miss distribution laws in hydropower engineering construction to reduce the possibility of accidents and efficiently improve the safety level of hydropower engineering construction sites. © 2022 Shu Chen et al.

N2  - Existing attempts to automate construction document analysis are limited in understanding the varied semantic properties of different documents. Due to the semantic conflicts, the construction specification review process is still conducted manually in practice despite the promising performance of the existing approaches. This research aimed to develop an automated system for reviewing construction specifications by analyzing the different semantic properties using natural language processing techniques. The proposed method analyzed varied semantic properties of 56 different specifications from five different countries in terms of vocabulary, sentence structure, and the organizing styles of provisions. First, the authors developed a semantic thesaurus for construction terms including 208 word-replacement rules based on Word2Vec embedding to understand the different vocabularies. Second, the authors developed a named entity recognition model based on bi-directional long short-term memory with a conditional random field layer, which identified the required keywords from given provisions with an averaged F1 score of 0.928. Third, the authors developed a provision-pairing model based on Doc2Vec embedding, which identified the most relevant provisions with an average accuracy of 84.4%. The web-based prototype demonstrated that the proposed system can facilitate the construction specification review process by reducing the time spent, supplementing the reviewer's experience, enhancing accuracy, and achieving consistency. The results contribute to risk management in the construction industry, with practitioners being able to review construction specifications thoroughly in spite of tight schedules and few available experts. © 2021 The Authors

N2  - According to the latest fatal work injury rates reported by the Bureau of Labors Statistics, construction sites remain the most hazardous workplaces. In the construction sector, fatality investigation summary reports are available for past accidents and by investigating such reports, valuable insights can be gained. In this study, text mining algorithms are explored for automatic construction accident causes classification. To be more specific, Word2Vec skip-gram model is utilized to learn word embedding from a domain-specific corpus and a hybrid structured deep neural network is proposed by incorporating the learned word embedding for accident reports classification. Dataset from Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is employed in the experiment to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. Besides, five baseline models: support vector machine (SVM), linear regression (LR), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), decision tree (DT), Naive Bayes (NB) are employed to compare with the proposed approach. Experiment results show that the proposed model achieves the highest average weighted F1 score among all models considered in this study. The result also proves the effectiveness of applying Word2Vec skip-gram algorithm for semantic information augmentation. As a result, robustness of the model is improved when classifying cases of low support values. © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.
